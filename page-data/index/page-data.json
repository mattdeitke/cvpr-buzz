In this paper, we leverage the availability of these two cameras for the task of illumination estimation using a small neural network to perform the illumination prediction. Specifically, if the two cameras' sensors have different spectral sensitivities, the two images provide different spectral measurements of the physical scene. A linear 3x3 color transform that maps between these two observations -- and that is unique to a given scene illuminant -- can be used to train a lightweight neural network comprising no more than 1460 parameters to predict the scene illumination. We demonstrate that this two-camera approach with a lightweight network provides results on par or better than much more complicated illuminant estimation methods operating on a single image. We validate our method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on radiometric data, a quasi-real two-camera dataset we generated from an existing single camera dataset, as well as a new real image dataset that we captured using a smartphone with two rear-facing cameras.","citations":null,"title":"Leveraging the Availability of Two Cameras for Illuminant Estimation","twitter":null,"id":"2667971c-cee9-559d-af03-13ebd5943e53","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Abdelhamed_Leveraging_the_Availability_of_Two_Cameras_for_Illuminant_Estimation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Abdelrahman Abdelhamed","Abhijith Punnappurath","Michael S.

Such desirable properties are absent in deep neural networks (DNNs), typically trained by non-linear fine-tuning of a pre-trained model. Previous attempts to linearize DNNs have led to interesting theoretical insights, but have not impacted the practice due to the substantial performance gap compared to standard non-linear optimization. We present the first method for linearizing a pre-trained model that achieves comparable performance to non-linear fine-tuning on most of real-world image classification tasks tested, thus enjoying the interpretability of linear models without incurring punishing losses in performance. LQF consists of simple modifications to the architecture, loss function and optimization typically used for classification: Leaky-ReLU instead of ReLU, mean squared loss instead of cross-entropy, and pre-conditioning using Kronecker factorization. None of these changes in isolation is sufficient to approach the performance of non-linear fine-tuning. When used in combination, they allow us to reach comparable performance, and even superior in the low-data regime, while enjoying the simplicity, robustness and interpretability of linear-quadratic optimization.","citations":1,"title":"LQF: Linear Quadratic Fine-Tuning","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":0,"retweets":2,"ids":["1342049481529851904","1341393494137589767","1341212168264552448"]},"id":"aff3b2ae-9b16-5b24-9304-06ccd1fc5861","s2id":"295c9f4511c8e0abf5718518910260467edecf46","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Achille_LQF_Linear_Quadratic_Fine-Tuning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Alessandro Achille","Aditya Golatkar","Avinash Ravichandran","Marzia Polito","Stefano Soatto"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11140"}},{"node":{"abstract":"While recent studies on semi-supervised learning have shown remarkable progress in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, most of them presume a basic setting of the model is randomly initialized. In this work, we consider semi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more practical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained models from the source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target domain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled target examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists of two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the examples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation Consistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples. Examples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected according to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and MURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show that our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean Teacher, and FixMatch. Moreover, our algorithm is orthogonal to existing methods and thus able to gain additional improvements on top of MixMatch and FixMatch.

As we demonstrate below, this leads to a rich set of signals for both the objective content and the affective impact of an image, creating associations with abstract concepts (e.g., \"freedom\" or \"love\"), or references that go beyond what is directly visible, including visual similes and metaphors, or subjective references to personal experiences. We focus on visual art (e.g., paintings, artistic photographs) as it is a prime example of imagery created to elicit emotional responses from its viewers. Our dataset, termed ArtEmis, contains 455K emotion attributions and explanations from humans, on 80K artworks from WikiArt. Building on this data, we train and demonstrate a series of captioning systems capable of expressing and explaining emotions from visual stimuli.

Simplifying GAN-based image generation is critical for their adoption in graphic design and artistic work. This goal has led to significant interest in methods that can intuitively control the appearance of images generated by GANs. In this paper, we present HistoGAN, a color histogram-based method for controlling GAN-generated images' colors. We focus on color histograms as they provide an intuitive way to describe image color while remaining decoupled from domain-specific semantics. Specifically, we introduce an effective modification of the recent StyleGAN architecture [31] to control the colors of GAN-generated images specified by a target color histogram feature. We then describe how to expand HistoGAN to recolor real images. For image recoloring, we jointly train an encoder network along with HistoGAN. The recoloring model, ReHistoGAN, is an unsupervised approach trained to encourage the network to keep the original image's content while changing the colors based on the given target histogram. We show that this histogram-based approach offers a better way to control GAN-generated and real images' colors while producing more compelling results compared to existing alternative strategies.","citations":1,"title":"HistoGAN: Controlling Colors of GAN-Generated and Real Images via Color Histograms","twitter":{"likes":141,"replies":3,"retweets":28,"ids":["1331413656270237699","1398372128127426562","1331459460653518851","1331736512493326338","1378986520170889216"]},"id":"72b14f55-2ef4-5128-b102-dec2c99d6b82","s2id":"0ddfdbf470c961bcf9ecbba42e9afebcbab044ee","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Afifi_HistoGAN_Controlling_Colors_of_GAN-Generated_and_Real_Images_via_Color_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Mahmoud Afifi","Marcus A.

Exposure problems are categorized as either: (i) overexposed, where the camera exposure was too long, resulting in bright and washed-out image regions, or (ii) underexposed, where the exposure was too short, resulting in dark regions. Both under- and overexposure greatly reduce the contrast and visual appeal of an image. Prior work mainly focuses on underexposed images or general image enhancement. In contrast, our proposed method targets both over- and under-exposure errors in photographs. We formulate the exposure correction problem as two main sub-problems: (i) color enhancement and (ii) detail enhancement. Accordingly, we propose a coarse-to-fine deep neural network (DNN) model, trainable in an end-to-end manner, that addresses each sub-problem separately. A key aspect of our solution is a new dataset of over 24,000 images exhibiting the broadest range of exposure values to date with a corresponding properly exposed image. Our method achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art methods on underexposed images and yields significant improvements for images suffering from overexposure errors.","citations":0,"title":"Learning Multi-Scale Photo Exposure Correction","twitter":{"likes":74,"replies":3,"retweets":22,"ids":["1243357000693497856","1243579787047841793","1243558889066356736","1243986274815369218","1243640019929026561","1331276671702487040","1331321816531542018","1243667202991153153","1243367387115581440","1243441215577751552","1243518438347362306","1243714559971659776","1243796567859040260","1243808825142099968","1243895870938062848","1244077095036346368","1244273196968312834","1331065177173762048","1331080462991839232","1243337122939052037"]},"id":"c902a1ab-0159-58e9-92ac-0cef42061049","s2id":"5960dd670496a6dfc37dac1d0b14b55a17ac527a","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Afifi_Learning_Multi-Scale_Photo_Exposure_Correction_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Mahmoud Afifi","Konstantinos G.

Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out the other label if it has already learned it. This setup is more aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of entities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still trying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables evaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot be easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be motivated by the example \"if a model was trained on the class 'bear' in one task and on 'polar bear' in another task, will it forget the concept of 'bear', will it rightfully infer that a 'polar bear' is still a 'bear'? and will it wrongfully associate the label of 'polar bear' to other breeds of 'bear'?\". We develop a standardized benchmark that enables evaluating models on the IIRC setup. We evaluate several state-of-the-art lifelong learning algorithms and highlight their strengths and limitations. For example, distillation-based methods perform relatively well but are prone to incorrectly predicting too many labels per image.

However, most of these conventional UDA approaches have a strong assumption of having access to the source data during training, which may not be very practical due to privacy, security and storage concerns. A recent line of work addressed this problem and proposed an algorithm that transfers knowledge to the unlabeled target domain only from a single learned source model without requiring access to the source data. However, for adaptation purpose, if there are multiple trained source models available to choose from, this method has to go through adapting each and every model individually, to check for the best source. Thus, we ask the question: can we find the optimal combination of source models, with no source data and without target labels, whose performance is no worse than the single best source? To answer this, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm which automatically combines the source models with suitable weights in such a way that it performs at least as good as the best source model. We provide intuitive theoretical insights to justify our claim.

A prior attempt to avoid this confound using randomized trials was unable to achieve results above chance in a statistically significant fashion when the data sets were of the same size as the original experiments. Here, we attempt object classification from EEG using an array of methods that are representative of the state-of-the-art, with a far larger (20x) dataset of randomized EEG trials, 1,000 stimulus presentations of each of forty classes, all from a single subject. To our knowledge, this is the largest such EEG data-collection effort from a single subject and is at the bounds of feasibility. We obtain classification accuracy that is marginally above chance and above chance in a statistically significant fashion, and further assess how accuracy depends on the classifier used, the amount of training data used, and the number of classes. Reaching the limits of data collection with only marginally above-chance performance suggests that the prevailing literature substantially exaggerates the feasibility of object classification from EEG.","citations":1,"title":"Object Classification From Randomized EEG Trials","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":1,"retweets":1,"ids":["1250652974491164672","1369445567496093698","1250066725321785346"]},"id":"f7a53055-a6b4-51d3-a8ce-7ffe87946f9c","s2id":"8f67627596e9fc66817a863e07d6607c817e73cd","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ahmed_Object_Classification_From_Randomized_EEG_Trials_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Hamad Ahmed","Ronnie B.

Local and global information are encoded in a combined embedding. A denoising pretext task provides the network with the needed local cues, decoupled from the high-level semantics and naturally shared over multiple classes. On the other hand, contrastive learning maximizes the agreement between variants of the same shape with different missing portions, thus producing a representation which captures the global appearance of the shape. The combined embedding inherits category-agnostic properties from the chosen pretext tasks. Differently from existing approaches, this allows to better generalize the completion properties to new categories unseen at training time. Moreover, while decoding the obtained joint representation, we better blend the reconstructed missing part with the partial shape by paying attention to its known surrounding region and reconstructing this frame as auxiliary objective.

In addition, 6DoF offers more information than face bounding box labels. We leverage these observations to make multiple contributions: (a) We describe an easily trained, efficient, Faster R-CNN-based model which regresses 6DoF pose for all faces in the photo, without preliminary face detection. (b) We explain how pose is converted and kept consistent between the input photo and arbitrary crops created while training and evaluating our model.

This paper attempts to address the problem of drones detection from other flying drones. The erratic movement of the source and target drones, small size, arbitrary shape, large intensity variations, and occlusion make this problem quite challenging. In this scenario, region-proposal based methods are not able to capture sufficient discriminative foreground-background information. Also, due to the extremely small size and complex motion of the source and target drones, feature aggregation based methods are unable to perform well. To handle this, instead of using region-proposal based methods, we propose to use a two-stage segmentation-based approach employing spatio-temporal attention cues. During the first stage, given the overlapping frame regions, detailed contextual information is captured over convolution feature maps using pyramid pooling. After that pixel and channel-wise attention is enforced on the feature maps to ensure accurate drone localization. In the second stage, first stage detections are verified and new probable drone locations are explored. To discover new drone locations, motion boundaries are used. This is followed by tracking candidate drone detections for a few frames, cuboid formation, extraction of the 3D convolution feature map, and drones detection within each cuboid. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available drone detection datasets and outperforms over several competitive baselines.","citations":0,"title":"Dogfight: Detecting Drones From Drones Videos","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":2,"retweets":0,"ids":["1383102978211581952","1378201496727207938","1377516285693599744"]},"id":"0aab871c-fe14-5096-9155-e6c763886b61","s2id":"ad778a8b70583f0f04e13d9034814b786f90de5b","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ashraf_Dogfight_Detecting_Drones_From_Drones_Videos_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Ashraf","Waqas Sultani","Mubarak Shah"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17242"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We propose an approach to domain adaptation for semantic segmentation that is both practical and highly accurate.

This is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels. We formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the training of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and 2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with a direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid producing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also facilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We develop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above criteria.

In this work we extend the above setting to consider the problem of training of deep neural networks that can be made simultaneously robust to perturbations applied in multiple natural representations spaces. For the case of image data, examples include the standard pixel representation as well as the representation in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis.

TTC presents several advantages, including requiring only a monocular, uncalibrated camera. However, regressing TTC for each pixel is not straightforward, and most existing methods make over-simplifying assumptions about the scene. We address this challenge by estimating TTC via a series of simpler, binary classifications. We predict with low latency whether the observer will collide with an obstacle within a certain time, which is often more critical than knowing exact, per-pixel TTC.

While extensive research efforts are devoted to improving compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. Especially at low bit rates, this information often corresponds to semantically meaningful visual cues, so that decompression involves significant ambiguity. In spite of this fact, existing decompression algorithms typically produce only a single output, and do not allow the viewer to explore the set of images that map to the given compressed code. In this work we propose the first image decompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of natural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus granting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been there in the original scene. Specifically, we develop a novel deep-network based decoder architecture for the ubiquitous JPEG standard, which allows traversing the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the compressed JPEG file. To allow for simple user interaction, we develop a graphical user interface comprising several intuitive exploration tools, including an automatic tool for examining specific solutions of interest. We exemplify our framework on graphical, medical and forensic use cases, demonstrating its wide range of potential applications.","citations":null,"title":"What's in the Image?

As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph. We further verify that the binary models offer significant savings on embedded devices.

In this paper, we reveal that the topology of the concatenation-type skip connections is closely related to the gradient propagation which, in turn, enables a predictable behavior of DNNs' test performance. To this end, we introduce a new metric called NN-Mass to quantify how effectively information flows through DNNs. Moreover, we empirically show that NN-Mass also works for other types of skip connections, e.g., for ResNets, Wide-ResNets (WRNs), and MobileNets, which contain addition-type skip connections (i.e., residuals or inverted residuals). As such, for both DenseNet-like CNNs and ResNets/WRNs/MobileNets, our theoretically grounded NN-Mass can identify models with similar accuracy, despite having significantly different size/compute requirements. Detailed experiments on both synthetic and real datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) provide extensive evidence for our insights. Finally, the closed-form equation of our NN-Mass enables us to design significantly compressed DenseNets (for CIFAR-10) and MobileNets (for ImageNet) directly at initialization without time-consuming training and/or searching.","citations":null,"title":"How Does Topology Influence Gradient Propagation and Model Performance of Deep Networks With DenseNet-Type Skip Connections?","twitter":{"likes":9,"replies":3,"retweets":2,"ids":["1179559025224163330","1304815722800046080","1180322959510032384","1179571882888241152","1179578122406109184","1179587803681820672","1179596930084564993","1179713218341736449","1179726909577580544","1179753223323820033","1393787294620999681","1377880773634764803","1281584210927595520","1281644654748856321","1281765490520666112","1281961566343254016","1282142913384898562","1282339096258633728","1282399623571628032","1281402908228177920"]},"id":"53d3967c-1d09-59e5-a614-77bd0b1fe0b7","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Bhardwaj_How_Does_Topology_Influence_Gradient_Propagation_and_Model_Performance_of_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Kartikeya Bhardwaj","Guihong Li","Radu Marculescu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00780"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Humans can easily infer the underlying 3D geometry and texture of an object only from a single 2D image. Current computer vision methods can do this, too, but suffer from view generalization problems -- the models inferred tend to make poor predictions of appearance in novel views. As for generalization problems in machine learning, the difficulty is balancing single-view accuracy (cf. training error; bias) with novel view accuracy (cf. test error; variance). We describe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to manage this tradeoff. We describe a cycle consistency loss that improves view generalization (roughly, a model from a generated view should predict the original view well). View generalization of textures requires that models share texture information, so a car seen from the back still has headlights because other cars have headlights. We describe a cycle consistency loss that encourages model textures to be aligned, so as to encourage sharing.

We argue that exploiting local priors allows our method to efficiently use input observations, thus improving generalization in visible areas of novel shapes. At the same time, the combination of local and global priors enables meaningful hallucination of unobserved parts resulting in consistent 3D shapes.

Second, we optimize the reasoning network of each resolution proportionally to its performance, hereby we motivate each resolution to specialize on the rules for which it performs better than the others and ignore cases that are already solved by the other resolutions.

In this paper, we aim to mitigate such an upper-bound on sketch data, and study whether unlabelled photos alone (of which they are many) can be cultivated for performance gain. In particular, we introduce a novel semi-supervised framework for cross-modal retrieval that can additionally leverage large-scale unlabelled photos to account for data scarcity. At the center of our semi-supervision design is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that aims to generate paired sketches for unlabelled photos. Importantly, we further introduce a discriminator-guided mechanism to guide against unfaithful generation, together with a distillation loss-based regularizer to provide tolerance against noisy training samples. Last but not least, we treat generation and retrieval as two conjugate problems, where a joint learning procedure is devised for each module to mutually benefit from each other.

In this paper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption that there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we will only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This results in creates a commercially viable solution -- being exposed to the new style, the model has the best shot at adaptation, and the few-sample nature makes it practical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework which exploits additional new-writer data via a support set, and outputs a writer-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We discover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key characters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For that, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a character-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with the sequential nature of text data. Our writer-adaptive MetaHTR framework can be easily implemented on the top of most state-of-the-art HTR models.

In contrast, controlled behavior synthesis and transfer across individuals requires a deep understanding of body dynamics and calls for a representation of behavior that is independent of appearance and also of specific postures. In this work, we present a model for human behavior synthesis which learns a dedicated representation of human dynamics independent of postures.

Given the alignment of the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps align with discriminative input patterns. These model-inherent decompositions are of high visual quality and outperform existing attribution methods under quantitative metrics. Further, CoDA-Nets constitute performant classifiers, achieving on par results to ResNet and VGG models on e.g. CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet.","citations":0,"title":"Convolutional Dynamic Alignment Networks for Interpretable Classifications","twitter":{"likes":14,"replies":0,"retweets":4,"ids":["1378892332888596487","1399983134838603776","1378616151236837380"]},"id":"3ed6e807-b1a7-5f1d-887f-bfef4f4e0f5d","s2id":"d15265907487e970a368eed375b3b54f5f5aee1d","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Bohle_Convolutional_Dynamic_Alignment_Networks_for_Interpretable_Classifications_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Moritz Bohle","Mario Fritz","Bernt Schiele"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00032"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Learning to model and predict how humans interact with objects while performing an action is challenging, and most of the existing video prediction models are ineffective in modeling complicated human-object interactions. Our work builds on hierarchical video prediction models, which disentangle the video generation process into two stages: predicting a high-level representation, such as pose sequence, and then learning a pose-to-pixels translation model for pixel generation. An action sequence for a human-object interaction task is typically very complicated, involving the evolution of pose, person's appearance, object locations, and object appearances over time. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Video Prediction model using Relational Layouts. In the first stage, we learn to predict a sequence of layouts. A layout is a high-level representation of the video containing both pose and objects' information for every frame. The layout sequence is learned by modeling the relationships between the pose and objects using relational reasoning and recurrent neural networks. The layout sequence acts as a strong structure prior to the second stage that learns to map the layouts into pixel space. Experimental evaluation of our method on two datasets, UMD-HOI and Bimanual, shows significant improvements in standard video evaluation metrics such as LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. We also perform a detailed qualitative analysis of our model to demonstrate various generalizations.","citations":null,"title":"Hierarchical Video Prediction Using Relational Layouts for Human-Object Interactions","twitter":null,"id":"d4da5ef2-102c-51af-91d9-73eaf6c69057","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Bodla_Hierarchical_Video_Prediction_Using_Relational_Layouts_for_Human-Object_Interactions_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Navaneeth Bodla","Gaurav Shrivastava","Rama Chellappa","Abhinav Shrivastava"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recent advances in 3D semantic scene understanding have shown impressive progress in 3D instance segmentation, enabling object-level reasoning about 3D scenes; however, a finer-grained understanding is required to enable interactions with objects and their functional understanding.

Addressing this problem, we first empirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of hardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon found in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose two hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard samples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The first one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the model predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class frequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior estimation algorithm. Finally, we design a new Self-Training framework with Hardness Sampling for T-ZSL, called STHS, where an arbitrary inductive ZSL method could be seamlessly embedded and it is iteratively trained with unseen-class samples selected by the hardness sampling approach. We introduce two typical ZSL methods into the STHS framework and extensive experiments demonstrate that the derived T-ZSL methods outperform many state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Besides, we note that the unseen-class dataset is separately used for training in some existing transductive generalized ZSL (T-GZSL) methods, which is not strict for a GZSL task.

As a result, one often resorts to subjective quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.","citations":null,"title":"Debiased Subjective Assessment of Real-World Image Enhancement","twitter":null,"id":"f24fa56c-7fef-59e2-b812-a96f1ae25b08","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Cao_Debiased_Subjective_Assessment_of_Real-World_Image_Enhancement_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Peibei Cao","Zhangyang Wang","Kede Ma"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Image-to-image (I2I) translation methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) typically suffer from overfitting when limited training data is available.

It is a crucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work, we present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network (SISNet), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level semantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape details as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily mixedup. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely completed semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the reconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative scene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion. Specifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for effectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be voxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS, fine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and thus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion. Utilizing such an iterative mechanism, the scene and instance completion benefits each other to achieve higher completion accuracy. Extensively experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both real NYU, NYUCAD and synthetic SUNCG-RGBD datasets.

Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image denoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in the above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which utilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow inference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and that of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise, which consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional methods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise affine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.

In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection. Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based generative models---contrary to the belief of some existing work---, and such features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection. Our results prompt re-thinking of using high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection.

While fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) strives to arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just \"bird\" would probably suffice. The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for different fine-grained definitions under divergent levels of expertise. For that, we re-envisage the traditional setting of FGVC, from single-label classification, to that of top-down traversal of a pre-defined coarse-to-fine label hierarchy -- so that our answer becomes \"bird\"=\"Phoenicopteriformes\"=\"Phoenicopteridae\"=\"flamingo\". To approach this new problem, we first conduct a comprehensive human study where we confirm that most participants prefer multi-granularity labels, regardless whether they consider themselves experts. We then discover the key intuition that: coarse-level label prediction exacerbates fine-grained feature learning, yet fine-level feature betters the learning of coarse-level classifier. This discovery enables us to design a very simple albeit surprisingly effective solution to our new problem, where we (i) leverage level-specific classification heads to disentangle coarse-level features with fine-grained ones, and (ii) allow finer-grained features to participate in coarser-grained label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting, and performs better than state-of-the-art on traditional single-label FGVC problem as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily implemented on top of any existing FGVC frameworks and is parameter-free.

Visual localization algorithms are a fundamental building block in advanced computer vision applications, including Mixed and Virtual Reality systems. Many algorithms used in practice represent the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud and use 2D-3D matches between a query image and the 3D points for camera pose estimation. As recently shown, image details can be accurately recovered from SfM point clouds by translating renderings of the sparse point clouds to images. To address the resulting potential privacy risks for user-generated content, it was recently proposed to lift point clouds to line clouds by replacing 3D points by randomly oriented 3D lines passing through these points. The resulting representation is unintelligible to humans and effectively prevents point cloud-to-image translation. This paper shows that a significant amount of information about the 3D scene geometry is preserved in these line clouds, allowing us to (approximately) recover the 3D point positions and thus to (approximately) recover image content. Our approach is based on the observation that the closest points between lines can yield a good approximation to the original 3D points.

To address these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses. Besides the integration of top-down and bottom-up networks, unlike existing pose discriminators that are designed solely for single person, and consequently cannot assess natural inter-person interactions, we propose a two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions.

However, the domain gap caused by drastically different light field acquisition conditions poses a main obstacle in practice. To fill this gap, we propose a zero-shot learning framework for light field SR, which learns a mapping to super-resolve the reference view with examples extracted solely from the input low-resolution light field itself. Given highly limited training data under the zero-shot setting, however, we observe that it is difficult to train an end-to-end network successfully. Instead, we divide this challenging task into three sub-tasks, i.e., pre-upsampling, view alignment, and multi-view aggregation, and then conquer them separately with simple yet efficient CNNs. Moreover, the proposed framework can be readily extended to finetune the pre-trained model on a source dataset to better adapt to the target input, which further boosts the performance of light field SR in the wild. Experimental results validate that our method not only outperforms classic non-learning-based methods, but also generalizes better to unseen light fields than state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods when the domain gap is large.","citations":null,"title":"Light Field Super-Resolution With Zero-Shot Learning","twitter":null,"id":"f8383a01-a7ba-519f-91c3-0d63de4b4d8c","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Cheng_Light_Field_Super-Resolution_With_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Zhen Cheng","Zhiwei Xiong","Chang Chen","Dong Liu","Zheng-Jun Zha"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recovering the 3D geometry of a purely texture-less object with generally unknown surface reflectance (e.g. nonLambertian) is regarded as a challenging task in multiview reconstruction.

Instead, we argue the problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface geometry and reflectance.

To tackle this problem, we divide camera-space mesh recovery into two sub-tasks, i.e., root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery. First, joint landmarks and silhouette are extracted from a single input image to provide 2D cues for the 3D tasks. In the root-relative mesh recovery task, we exploit semantic relations among joints to generate a 3D mesh from the extracted 2D cues. Such generated 3D mesh coordinates are expressed relative to a root position, i.e., wrist of the hand. In the root recovery task, the root position is registered to the camera space by aligning the generated 3D mesh back to 2D cues, thereby completing camera-space 3D mesh recovery. Our pipeline is novel in that (1) it explicitly makes use of known semantic relations among joints and (2) it exploits 1D projections of the silhouette and mesh to achieve robust registration. Extensive experiments on popular datasets such as FreiHAND, RHD, and Human3.6M demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery.

In this work, to address the issue, we present a novel class-aware robust adversarial training paradigm for the object detection task. For a given image, the proposed approach generates a universal adversarial perturbation to simultaneously attack all the occurred objects in the image through jointly maximizing the respective loss for each object. Meanwhile, instead of normalizing the total loss with the number of objects, the proposed approach decomposes the total loss into class-wise losses and normalizes each class loss using the number of objects for the class. The adversarial training based on the class weighted loss can not only balances the influence of each class but also effectively and evenly improves the adversarial robustness of trained models for all the object classes as compared with the previous defense methods. Furthermore, with the recent development of fast adversarial training, we provide a fast version of the proposed algorithm which can be trained faster than the traditional adversarial training while keeping comparable performance.

Given a low-resolution coarse voxel shape, our network refines it, via voxel upsampling, into a higher-resolution shape enriched with geometric details.

We model the CNN feature maps across different layers, as a dynamic process which carries the statistical self-similarity (SSS), one well-known property of texture, from input image along the network depth dimension. The CLASS module characterizes the cross-layer SSS using a soft histogram of local differential box-counting dimensions of cross-layer features. The resulting descriptor encodes both cross-layer dynamics and local SSS of input image, providing additional discrimination over the often-used global average pooling.

Existing methods either directly use the validation performance or learn a predictor to estimate the performance. However, these methods can be either computationally expensive or very inaccurate, which may severely affect the search efficiency and performance. Moreover, as it is very difficult to annotate architectures with accurate performance on specific tasks, learning a promising performance predictor is often non-trivial due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we argue that it may not be necessary to estimate the absolute performance for NAS. On the contrary, we may need only to understand whether an architecture is better than a baseline one. However, how to exploit this comparison information as the reward and how to well use the limited labeled data remains two great challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Neural Architecture Search (CTNAS) method which performs architecture search by taking the comparison results between architectures as the reward. Specifically, we design and learn a Neural Architecture Comparator (NAC) to compute the probability of candidate architectures being better than a baseline one. Moreover, we present a baseline updating scheme to improve the baseline iteratively in a curriculum learning manner. More critically, we theoretically show that learning NAC is equivalent to optimizing the ranking over architectures.

While many past approaches have been based on either non-equivariant or invariant descriptors to align 3D shapes, we argue that such tasks may benefit greatly from an equivariant framework. In this paper, we propose an effective and practical SE(3) (3D translation and rotation) equivariant network for point cloud analysis that addresses both problems. First, we present SE(3) separable point convolution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D convolution into two separable convolutional operators alternatively performed in the 3D Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. This significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising the performance. Second, we introduce an attention layer to effectively harness the expressiveness of the equivariant features. While jointly trained with the network, the attention layer implicitly derives the intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates attention vectors that can be integrated into different alignment tasks.

However, we discover that surprisingly simple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling) outperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for different data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially when the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a Generalized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself to the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning while staying effective and efficient. We extend the VSE model using this proposed GPO and denote it as VSE. Without bells and whistles, VSE outperforms previous VSE methods significantly on image-text retrieval benchmarks across popular feature extractors. With a simple adaptation, variants of VSE further demonstrate its strength by achieving the new state of the art on two video-text retrieval datasets.

However, previous works often fail to generate plausible high quality (HQ) results for real-world low quality (LQ) face images. In this paper, we propose a new progressive semantic-aware style transformation framework, named PSFR-GAN, for face restoration. Specifically, instead of using an encoder-decoder framework as previous methods, we formulate the restoration of LQ face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration procedure through semantic-aware style transformation. Given a pair of LQ face image and its corresponding parsing map, we first generate a multi-scale pyramid of the inputs, and then progressively modulate different scale features from coarse-to-fine in a semantic-aware style transfer way. Compared with previous networks, the proposed PSFR-GAN makes full use of the semantic (parsing maps) and pixel (LQ images) space information from different scales of input pairs. In addition, we further introduce a semantic aware style loss which calculates the feature style loss for each semantic region individually to improve the details of face textures. Finally, we pretrain a face parsing network which can generate decent parsing maps from real-world LQ face images. Experiment results show that our model trained with synthetic data can produce more realistic high-resolution results for synthetic LQ inputs than state-of-the-art methods and generalize better to natural LQ face images.","citations":2,"title":"Progressive Semantic-Aware Style Transformation for Blind Face Restoration","twitter":{"likes":56,"replies":3,"retweets":14,"ids":["1307845302494416896","1308029314470903808","1310650622987964416","1311245648314892288","1310883204308627457","1309293203728658433","1308708675679408135","1308126714313281536","1308053676636934145","1307962950716588032","1307875780509097986","1307864989865213955","1307864511639031809","1307857313584345089","1307848121972592640"]},"id":"c0435b89-5bb2-5d9b-9cf2-3742a8d534e7","s2id":"1b8e9c1cc34846e4396f4accd4114bab686829f4","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Chen_Progressive_Semantic-Aware_Style_Transformation_for_Blind_Face_Restoration_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Chaofeng Chen","Xiaoming Li","Lingbo Yang","Xianhui Lin","Lei Zhang","Kwan-Yee K.

First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively.

It has always been challenging due to large variations in text shapes, fonts, backgrounds, etc. However, most existing methods employ generic super-resolution frameworks to handle scene text images while ignoring text-specific properties such as text-level layouts and character-level details. In this paper, we establish a text-focused super-resolution framework, called Scene Text Telescope (STT). In terms of text-level layouts, we propose a Transformer-Based Super-Resolution Network (TBSRN) containing a Self-Attention Module to extract sequential information, which is robust to tackle the texts in arbitrary orientations. In terms of character-level details, we propose a Position-Aware Module and a Content-Aware Module to highlight the position and the content of each character. By observing that some characters look indistinguishable in low-resolution conditions, we use a weighted cross-entropy loss to tackle this problem. We conduct extensive experiments, including text recognition with pre-trained recognizers and image quality evaluation, on TextZoom and several scene text recognition benchmarks to assess the super-resolution images.

Pre-trained weights often boost a wide range of downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Latest studies suggest that pre-training benefits from gigantic model capacity. We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its downstream transferability? In this paper, we examine supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch yet still reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH and question whether matching subnetworks still exist in pre-trained computer vision models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR, and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities. We conclude that the core LTH observations remain generally relevant in the pre-training paradigm of computer vision, but more delicate discussions are needed in some cases.

Analogously, in this paper we explore improving camera pose regression by instead predicting a discrete distribution over camera poses. To realize this idea, we introduce DirectionNet, which estimates discrete distributions over the 5D relative pose space using a novel parameterization to make the estimation problem tractable. Specifically, DirectionNet factorizes relative camera pose, specified by a 3D rotation and a translation direction, into a set of 3D direction vectors. Since 3D directions can be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our model on challenging synthetic and real pose estimation datasets constructed from Matterport3D and InteriorNet.

We train on multiple scenes of the DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10 sparse and spread-out views as input.

Furthermore, GANs are especially useful for controllable generation since their latent spaces contain a wide range of interpretable directions, well suited for semantic editing operations. By gradually changing latent codes along these directions, one can produce impressive visual effects, unattainable without GANs. In this paper, we significantly expand the range of visual effects achievable with the state-of-the-art models, like StyleGAN2. In contrast to existing works, which mostly operate by latent codes, we  discover interpretable directions in the space of the generator parameters.

Most existing deep end-to-end learning approaches adopt the same generic model for all unseen test images. These solutions are sub-optimal, as they fail to utilize the internal information within a specific image. On the other hand, a self-supervised approach, SelfDeblur, enables internal-training within a test image from scratch, but it does not fully take advantages of large external dataset. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning to improve the performance of deblurring by integrating both external and internal learning. Concretely, we build a self-supervised auxiliary reconstruction task which shares a portion of the network with the primary deblurring task. The two tasks are jointly trained on an external dataset. Furthermore, we propose a meta-auxiliary training scheme to further optimize the pre-trained model as a base learner which is applicable for fast adaptation at test time. During training, the performance of both tasks is coupled. Therefore, we are able to exploit the internal information at test time via the auxiliary task to enhance the performance of deblurring.

We derive that three terms should be considered together when estimating the probability of a classifier making a mistake for a given sample; i) probability of mislabelling a class, ii) likelihood of the data given a predicted class, and iii) the prior probability on the abundance of a predicted class. Implementing these terms requires a generative model and an intractable likelihood estimation. Therefore, we train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for this purpose. To further tie the VAE with the classifier and facilitate VAE training, we use the classifiers' deep feature representations as input to the VAE. By considering all three probabilities, among them especially the data imbalance, we can substantially improve the potential of existing methods under limited data budget.

We argue that the limitation stems from several challenges: as the resolution increases, the artifacts in the misaligned areas between the warped clothes and the desired clothing regions become noticeable in the final results; the architectures used in existing methods have low performance in generating high-quality body parts and maintaining the texture sharpness of the clothes. To address the challenges, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called VITON-HD that successfully synthesizes 1024x768 virtual try-on images.

Mask-ToF starts at the source of these FPs, learning a microlens-level occlusion mask which effectively creates a custom-shaped sub-aperture for each sensor pixel. This modulates the selection of foreground and background light mixtures on a per-pixel basis and thereby encodes scene geometric information directly into the ToF measurements. We develop a differentiable ToF simulator to jointly train a convolutional neural network to decode this information and produce high-fidelity, low-FP depth reconstructions. We test the effectiveness of Mask-ToF on a simulated light field dataset and validate the method with an experimental prototype.

Recently, learned image compression methods had exceeded their classical counterparts in terms of rate-distortion performance. However, continuous rate adaptation remains an open question. Some learned image compression methods use multiple networks for multiple rates, while others use one single model at the expense of computational complexity increase and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a continuously rate adjustable learned image compression framework, Asymmetric Gained Variational Autoencoder (AG-VAE). AG-VAE utilizes a pair of gain units to achieve discrete rate adaptation in one single model with a negligible additional computation. Then, by using exponential interpolation, continuous rate adaptation is achieved without compromising performance. Besides, we propose the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model for more accurate entropy estimation. Exhaustive experiments show that our method achieves comparable quantitative performance with SOTA learned image compression methods and better qualitative performance than classical image codecs. In the ablation study, we confirm the usefulness and superiority of gain units and the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model.","citations":null,"title":"Asymmetric Gained Deep Image Compression With Continuous Rate Adaptation","twitter":null,"id":"a69f82da-c807-5df3-8a96-90bb759e8664","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Cui_Asymmetric_Gained_Deep_Image_Compression_With_Continuous_Rate_Adaptation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Ze Cui","Jing Wang","Shangyin Gao","Tiansheng Guo","Yihui Feng","Bo Bai"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"In this paper we introduce SMPLicit, a novel generative model to jointly represent body pose, shape and clothing geometry.

We show our model to be applicable to a large variety of garments including T-shirts, hoodies, jackets, shorts, pants, skirts, shoes and even hair. The representation flexibility of SMPLicit builds upon an implicit model conditioned with the SMPL human body parameters and a learnable latent space which is semantically interpretable and aligned with the clothing attributes. The proposed model is fully differentiable, allowing for its use into larger end-to-end trainable systems. In the experimental section, we demonstrate SMPLicit can be readily used for fitting 3D scans and for 3D reconstruction in images of dressed people.

Recent studies have focused on a \"nested dropout\" layer, which is able to order the nodes of a layer by importance during training, thus generating a nested set of sub-networks that are optimal for different configurations of resources. However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyper-parameter over different layers during the whole training process. Therefore, when nodes are removed, the performance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory learned from data. Another drawback is the generated sub-networks are deterministic networks without well-calibrated uncertainty. To address these two problems, we develop a Bayesian approach to nested neural networks. We propose a variational ordering unit that draws samples for nested dropout at a low cost, from a proposed Downhill distribution, which provides useful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach, we design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of the node distributions. In experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms the nested network in terms of accuracy, calibration, and out-of-domain detection in classification tasks.

Recently, continuous efforts have been devoted to addressing this issue, which has achieved remarkable progress. However, the existing work is seriously limited by complete observation, that is, once the historical motion sequence is incomplete (with missing values), it can only produce unexpected predictions or even deformities. Furthermore, due to inevitable reasons such as occlusion and the lack of equipment precision, the incompleteness of motion data occurs frequently, which hinders the practical application of current algorithms. In this work, we first notice this challenging problem, i.e., how to generate high-fidelity human motion predictions from incomplete observations. To solve it, we propose a novel multi-task graph convolutional network (MT-GCN). Specifically, the model involves two branches, in which the primary task is to focus on forecasting future 3D human actions accurately, while the auxiliary one is to repair the missing value of the incomplete observation. Both of them are integrated into a unified framework to share the spatio-temporal representation, which improves the final performance of each collaboratively. On three large-scale datasets, for various data missing scenarios in the real world, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is consistently superior to the state-of-the-art methods in which the missing values from incomplete observations are not explicitly analyzed.","citations":null,"title":"Towards Accurate 3D Human Motion Prediction From Incomplete Observations","twitter":null,"id":"2bc96755-3918-53fc-afaa-7c3570409df4","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Cui_Towards_Accurate_3D_Human_Motion_Prediction_From_Incomplete_Observations_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Qiongjie Cui","Huaijiang Sun"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) demonstrate powerful representation ability to model graphs with hierarchical structure.

However, current approaches hardly take into consideration the semantic sample relationships that existed in both local and global features. In addition, since the deep features are updated on-the-fly, relying on these sample relationships may construct more semantically confident sample pairs, leading to inferior performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a method called Nearest Neighbor Matching (NNM) to match samples with their nearest neighbors from both local (batch) and global (overall) levels. Specifically, for the local level, we match the nearest neighbors based on batch embedded features, as for the global one, we match neighbors from overall embedded features. To keep the clustering assignment consistent in both neighbors and classes, we frame consistent loss and class contrastive loss for both local and global levels. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our new model against state-of-the-art methods.

The main idea in IntroVAE is to train a VAE adversarially, using the VAE encoder to discriminate between generated and real data samples. However, the original IntroVAE loss function relied on a particular hinge-loss formulation that is very hard to stabilize in practice, and its theoretical convergence analysis ignored important terms in the loss. In this work, we take a step towards better understanding of the IntroVAE model, its practical implementation, and its applications. We propose the Soft-IntroVAE, a modified IntroVAE that replaces the hinge-loss terms with a smooth exponential loss on generated samples. This change significantly improves training stability, and also enables theoretical analysis of the complete algorithm. Interestingly, we show that the IntroVAE converges to a distribution that minimizes a sum of KL distance from the data distribution and an entropy term. We discuss the implications of this result, and demonstrate that it induces competitive image generation and reconstruction.

On the other hand, learning from inexpensive and intuitive basic categorical emotion labels leads to limited emotion variability. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based framework which learns an expressive and interpretable conditional space (usable as a label space) of emotions, instead of conditioning on handcrafted labels. Our framework only uses the categorical labels of basic emotions to jointly learn the conditional space as well as the emotion manipulation. Such learning can benefit from the image variability within discrete labels, especially when the intrinsic labels reside beyond the discrete space of the defined.

The sketch stage first generates a coarse-grained multi-sentence paragraph to describe the whole video, where each sentence is treated as an event and gets localised in the grounding stage. In the refining stage, we improve captioning quality via refinement-enhanced training and dual-path cross attention on both coarse-grained event captions and aligned event segments. The updated event caption can further adjust its segment boundaries. Our SGR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ActivityNet Captioning benchmark under traditional and story-oriented dense caption evaluations.

Previous methods overcome this barrier by computing pixel-wise correspondences between two images, which is inaccurate and computational-expensive. In this paper, we take a different perspective to break down the makeup transfer problem into a two-step extraction-assignment process. To this end, we propose a Style-based Controllable GAN model that consists of three components, each of which corresponds to target style-code encoding, face identity features extraction, and makeup fusion, respectively. In particular, a Part-specific Style Encoder encodes the component-wise makeup style of the reference image into a style-code in an intermediate latent space W. The style-code discards spatial information and therefore is invariant to spatial misalignment. On the other hand, the style-code embeds component-wise information, enabling flexible partial makeup editing from multiple references. This style-code, together with source identity features, are integrated to a Makeup Fusion Decoder equipped with multiple AdaIN layers to generate the final result. Our proposed method demonstrates great flexibility on makeup transfer by supporting makeup removal, shade-controllable makeup transfer, and part-specific makeup transfer, even with large spatial misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

The robustness of skeleton-based activity recognizers has been questioned recently, which shows that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when the full-knowledge of the recognizer is accessible to the attacker. However, this white-box requirement is overly restrictive in most scenarios and the attack is not truly threatening. In this paper, we show that such threats do exist under black-box settings too. To this end, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method BASAR. Through BASAR, we show that adversarial attack is not only truly a threat but also can be extremely deceitful, because on-manifold adversarial samples are rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and attack modes. Through harsh perceptual studies, we show that it achieves effective yet imperceptible attacks. By analyzing the attack on different activity recognizers, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of their vulnerability and provides insights on what classifiers are likely to be more robust against attack.","citations":1,"title":"BASAR:Black-Box Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1379139526061404171"]},"id":"b1f5b45f-6ca2-5fca-9839-c85e08f515e3","s2id":"02dc03dddbe81dfe84fb3097cf3742b21f6073d5","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Diao_BASARBlack-Box_Attack_on_Skeletal_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Yunfeng Diao","Tianjia Shao","Yong-Liang Yang","Kun Zhou","He Wang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05266"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We propose a universal building block of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to improve the performance without any inference-time costs.

Although modern instance segmentation cascades achieve leading performance, they mainly make use of a unidirectional relationship, i.e., mask segmentation can benefit from iteratively refined bounding box detection. In this paper, we investigate an alternative direction, i.e., how to take the advantage of precise mask segmentation for bounding box detection in a cascade architecture. We propose a Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation, which iteratively imposes the shape guidances extracted from mask prediction at previous stage on bounding box detection at current stage. It forms a bi-directional relationship between the two tasks by introducing three key components: (1) Initial shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) with the ability to generate class-agnostic masks; (2) Explicit shape guidance: A mask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor, which employs mask segmentation at previous stage to focus feature extraction at current stage within a region aligned well with the shape of the instance-of-interest rather than a rectangular RoI; (3) Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation which feeds intermediate mask features at previous stage to the bounding box head at current stage. Experimental results show that DSC outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), by a large margin and achieves 51.8 box AP and 45.5 mask AP on COCO test-dev.

In HR-NAS, we renovate the NAS search space as well as its searching strategy. To better encode multiscale image contexts in the search space of HR-NAS, we first carefully design a lightweight transformer, whose computational complexity can be dynamically changed with respect to different objective functions and computation budgets. To maintain high-resolution representations of the learned networks, HR-NAS adopts a multi-branch architecture that provides convolutional encoding of multiple feature resolutions, inspired by HRNet. Last, we proposed an efficient fine-grained search strategy to train HR-NAS, which effectively explores the search space, and finds optimal architectures given various tasks and computation resources. HR-NAS is capable of achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs for three dense prediction tasks and an image classification task, given only small computational budgets. For example, HR-NAS surpasses SqueezeNAS that is specially designed for semantic segmentation by a large margin of 3.61% while improving efficiency by 45.9%.

Such a mapping is estimated with either a convolution neural network or a decision tree using only the static input image sequence, which makes these approaches vulnerable to dynamic indoor environments that are quite common yet challenging in the real world. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree which bridges the two worlds, deep learning and decision tree approaches. It builds on three important blocks: (a) a hierarchical space partition over the indoor scene to construct the decision tree; (b) a neural routing function, implemented as a deep classification network, employed for better 3D scene understanding; and (c) an outlier rejection module used to filter out dynamic points during the hierarchical routing process. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on the RIO-10 benchmark developed for camera relocalization in dynamic indoor environments. It achieves robust neural routing through space partitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by around 30% on camera pose accuracy, while running comparably fast for evaluation.","citations":1,"title":"Robust Neural Routing Through Space Partitions for Camera Relocalization in Dynamic Indoor Environments","twitter":{"likes":13,"replies":1,"retweets":2,"ids":["1367216467909865473","1379429056253460480","1377506282806992903","1337158063032156161","1337044748922740736","1336863317042868227"]},"id":"3fbd8bda-bbab-57c6-99c8-fa62150bdcd4","s2id":"5249d188beda2ec2820834fc932e6da1f5902feb","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Dong_Robust_Neural_Routing_Through_Space_Partitions_for_Camera_Relocalization_in_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Siyan Dong","Qingnan Fan","He Wang","Ji Shi","Li Yi","Thomas Funkhouser","Baoquan Chen","Leonidas J.

This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes.

This naturally suggests a bijective mapping between the video domain and the static content as well as residual information. In contrast to common stochastic image-to-video synthesis, such a model does not merely generate arbitrary videos progressing the initial image. Given this image, it rather provides a one-to-one mapping between the residual vectors and the video with stochastic outcomes when sampling. The approach is naturally implemented using a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) that can explain videos by independently modelling static and other video characteristics, thus laying the basis for controlled video synthesis.

Our central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first uses effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the second relies on a finite number of independent models. To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the cost.

The core idea of our work is to drop constraints from each feature descriptor by embedding it within an affine subspace containing the original feature as well as adversarial feature samples. Feature matching on the privacy-preserving representation is enabled based on the notion of subspace-to-subspace distance.

Recently, adversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has been introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between different domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only focus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers. However, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target samples, i.e., traget samples may match to wrong categories even if the discrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM) method which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by source samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for the semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good supervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the gradient signal of target smaples, we further obtain target pseudo labels through a clustering-based self-supervised learning.

This trade-off could be mitigated if gallery embeddings are generated from a large model and query embeddings are extracted using a compact model. The key to building such a system is to ensure representation compatibility between the query and gallery models.

The proposed task softly segments 3D points into a discrete number of geometric partitions. A self-supervised loss is formed under the interpretation that these soft partitions implicitly parameterize a latent Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and that this generative model establishes a data likelihood function. Our pretext task can therefore be viewed in terms of an encoder-decoder paradigm that squeezes learned representations through an implicitly defined parametric discrete generative model bottleneck. We show that any existing neural network architecture designed for supervised point cloud segmentation can be repurposed for the proposed unsupervised pretext task. By maximizing data likelihood with respect to the soft partitions formed by the unsupervised point-wise segmentation network, learned representations are encouraged to contain compositionally rich geometric information.

However, how to effectively model linguistic rules in end-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper, we argue that the limited capacity of language models comes from: 1) implicitly language modeling; 2) unidirectional feature representation; and 3) language model with noise input. Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and iterative ABINet for scene text recognition. Firstly, the autonomous suggests to block gradient flow between vision and language models to enforce explicitly language modeling. Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language model is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an execution manner of iterative correction for language model which can effectively alleviate the impact of noise input.

Crucially, such a mental representation takes the agent's belief into account so that it represents what the true world state is and infers the beliefs in each agent's mental state, which may differ from the true world states. By aggregating different beliefs and true world states, our model essentially forms \"five minds\" during the interactions between two agents.

Based on this representation, we further devise a hierarchical energy-based model that jointly tracks and predicts all five minds. From this new perspective, a social event is interpreted by a series of nonverbal communication and belief dynamics, which transcends the classic keyframe video summary.

The CDT loss encourages learning semantically meaningful features by enforcing compact feature clusters of identities from one domain, where the compactness is measured by underlying similarity metrics that belong to another training domain with different statistics. Intuitively, it discriminatively correlates explicit metrics derived from one domain, with triplet samples from another domain in a unified loss function to be minimized within a network, which leads to better alignment of the training domains.

Unfortunately, the GPU memory is physically finite, which limits the image resolutions and batch sizes that could be used in training for better DNN performance. Unlike solutions that require physically upgrade GPUs, the Gradient CheckPointing(GCP) training trades computation for more memory beyond existing GPU hardware. GCP only stores a subset of intermediate tensors, called Gradient Checkpoints (GCs), during forward. Then during backward, extra local forwards are conducted to compute the missing tensors. The total training memory cost becomes the sum of (1) the memory cost of the gradient checkpoints and (2) the maximum memory cost of local forwards. To achieve maximal memory cut-offs, one needs optimal algorithms to select GCs. Existing GCP approaches rely on either manual input of GCs or heuristics-based GC search on Linear Computation Graphs (LCGs), and cannot apply to Arbitrary Computation Graphs(ACGs). In this paper, we present theories and optimal algorithms on GC selection that, for the first time, are applicable to ACGs and achieve the maximal memory cut-offs. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only outperforms existing approaches (only applicable on LCGs), and is applicable to a vast family of LCG and ACG networks, such as Alexnet, VGG, ResNet, Densenet, Inception Net and highly complicated DNNs by Network Architecture Search.

And where should I improve? Ah, my back hurts slightly... User engagement can be sustained and injuries avoided by being able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, relate it to good training practices, identify errors, and provide early, real-time feedback. In this paper we introduce the first automatic system, AIFit, that performs 3d human sensing for fitness training. The system can be used at home, outdoors, or at the gym. AIFit is able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, reliably segment exercise repetitions, and identify in real-time the deviations between standards learnt from trainers, and the execution of a trainee. As a result, localized, quantitative feedback for correct execution of exercises, reduced risk of injury, and continuous improvement is possible. To support research and evaluation, we introduce the first large scale dataset, Fit3D, containing over 3 million images and corresponding 3d human shape and motion capture ground truth configurations, with over 37 repeated exercises, covering all the major muscle groups, performed by instructors and trainees. Our statistical coach is governed by a global parameter that captures how critical it should be of a trainee's performance. This is an important aspect that helps adapt to a student's level of fitness (i.e. beginner vs. advanced vs. expert), or to the expected accuracy of a 3d pose reconstruction method.

However, the default setting of MSDA may neglect the issue of \"partialness\", i.e., 1) a part of the features contained in the union set of multiple source domains may not present in the target domain; 2) the label space of the target domain may not completely overlap with the multiple source domains.

By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Despite the significant advances in UDA, the performance gap remains quite large between UDA and supervised learning with fully labeled target data. Active domain adaptation (ADA) mitigates the gap under minimal annotation cost by selecting a small quota of target samples to annotate and incorporating them into training. Due to the domain shift, the query selection criteria of prior active learning methods may be ineffective to select the most informative target samples for annotation. In this paper, we propose Transferable Query Selection (TQS), which selects the most informative samples under domain shift by an ensemble of three new criteria: transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness. We further develop a randomized selection algorithm to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments show that TQS remarkably outperforms previous UDA and ADA methods on several domain adaptation datasets. Deeper analyses demonstrate that TQS can select the most informative target samples under the domain shift.","citations":0,"title":"Transferable Query Selection for Active Domain Adaptation","twitter":null,"id":"9b5e6903-04b6-5140-91e7-50b32791dad5","s2id":"301ca7cfed69c7747d2bf53bf9d17d08a200f0ed","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Fu_Transferable_Query_Selection_for_Active_Domain_Adaptation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Bo Fu","Zhangjie Cao","Jianmin Wang","Mingsheng Long"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present ARCH, a computational pathology (CP) multiple instance captioning dataset to facilitate dense supervision of CP tasks.

In this paper, we propose to explicitly formulate pairwise graph structures as a quadratic constraint incorporated into the DGM framework. The quadratic constraint minimizes the pairwise structural discrepancy between graphs, which can reduce the ambiguities brought by only using the extracted CNN features. Moreover, we present a differentiable implementation to the quadratic constrained-optimization such that it is compatible with the unconstrained deep learning optimizer. To give more precise and proper supervision, a well-designed false matching loss against class imbalance is proposed, which can better penalize the false negatives and false positives with less overfitting.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method named HifaFace to address the above-mentioned problem from two perspectives. First, we relieve the pressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator. Second, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to synthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the high-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice that a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great importance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute regression loss.

In this work, we propose a novel information disentangling and swapping network, called InfoSwap, to extract the most expressive information for identity representation from a pre-trained face recognition model.

We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled keypoint regression (DEKR). We adopt adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial transformer to activate the pixels in the keypoint regions and accordingly learn representations from them. We use a multi-branch structure for separate regression: each branch learns a representation with dedicated adaptive convolutions and regresses one keypoint. The resulting disentangled representations are able to attend to the keypoint regions, respectively, and thus the keypoint regression is spatially more accurate. We empirically show that the proposed direct regression method outperforms keypoint detection and grouping methods and achieves superior bottom-up pose estimation results on two benchmark datasets, COCO and CrowdPose.

Many recent 3D facial texture reconstruction and pose manipulation from a single image approaches still rely on large and clean face datasets to train image-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Yet the collection of such a large scale high-resolution 3D texture dataset is still very costly and difficult to maintain age/ethnicity balance. Moreover, regression-based approaches suffer from generalization to the in-the-wild conditions and are unable to fine-tune to a target-image. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for one-shot 3D facial texture completion that does not require large-scale texture datasets, but rather harnesses the knowledge stored in 2D face generators. The proposed approach rotates an input image in 3D and fill-in the unseen regions by reconstructing the rotated image in a 2D face generator, based on the visible parts. Finally, we stitch the most visible textures at different angles in the UV image-plane. Further, we frontalize the target image by projecting the completed texture into the generator. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the completed UV textures and frontalized images are of high quality, resembles the original identity, can be used to train a texture GAN model for 3DMM fitting and improve pose-invariant face recognition.","citations":2,"title":"OSTeC: One-Shot Texture Completion","twitter":{"likes":134,"replies":0,"retweets":25,"ids":["1344861392852164608","1345990257062285312","1346619102618480640"]},"id":"ef3a096d-30cf-50f4-9c2a-b5a58818fd86","s2id":"9cb2f013ae9137b6dc7c7cb96efdda7569c2af3f","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Gecer_OSTeC_One-Shot_Texture_Completion_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Baris Gecer","Jiankang Deng","Stefanos Zafeiriou"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15370"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Anomaly detection in video is a challenging computer vision problem. Due to the lack of anomalous events at training time, anomaly detection requires the design of learning methods without full supervision. In this paper, we approach anomalous event detection in video through self-supervised and multi-task learning at the object level. We first utilize a pre-trained detector to detect objects. Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce discriminative anomaly-specific information by jointly learning multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation. The self-supervised tasks are: (i) discrimination of forward/backward moving objects (arrow of time), (ii) discrimination of objects in consecutive/intermittent frames (motion irregularity) and (iii) reconstruction of object-specific appearance information. The knowledge distillation task takes into account both classification and detection information, generating large prediction discrepancies between teacher and student models when anomalies occur. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach anomalous event detection in video as a multi-task learning problem, integrating multiple self-supervised and knowledge distillation proxy tasks in a single architecture. Our lightweight architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2.

Prior methods are heavily based on human parsing. However, slightly-wrong segmentation results would lead to unrealistic try-on images with large artifacts. Inaccurate parsing misleads parser-based methods to produce visually unrealistic results where artifacts usually occur. A recent pioneering work employed knowledge distillation to reduce the dependency of human parsing, where the try-on images produced by a parser-based method are used as supervisions to train a \"student\" network without relying on segmentation, making the student mimic the try-on ability of the parser-based model. However, the image quality of the student is bounded by the parser-based model. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, \"teacher-tutor-student\" knowledge distillation, which is able to produce highly photo-realistic images without human parsing, possessing several appealing advantages compared to prior arts. (1) Unlike existing work, our approach treats the fake images produced by the parser-based method as \"tutor knowledge\", where the artifacts can be corrected by real \"teacher knowledge\", which is extracted from the real person images in a self-supervised way. (2) Other than using real images as supervisions, we formulate knowledge distillation in the try-on problem as distilling the appearance flows between the person image and the garment image, enabling us to find accurate dense correspondences between them to produce high-quality results.

We argue that generating putative 2D-3D correspondences 1) leads to an important loss of information that needs to be compensated as far as possible, within RE, through the choice of a robust loss and the tuning of its hyperparameters and 2) may lead to an RE that conveys erroneous data to the pose estimator. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for RE. NRE allows to rethink the camera pose estimation problem by merging it with the feature learning problem, hence leveraging richer information than 2D-3D correspondences and eliminating the need for choosing a robust loss and its hyperparameters. Thus NRE can be used as training loss to learn image descriptors tailored for pose estimation. We also propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method able to very efficiently minimize a sum of NRE terms w.r.t. the camera pose. We experimentally demonstrate that NRE is a good substitute for RE as it significantly improves both the robustness and the accuracy of the camera pose estimate while being computationally and memory highly efficient.

Several recent approaches have successfully leveraged the idea of making such a representation invariant under different types of perturbations, especially via contrastive-based instance discrimination training. Although effective visual representations should indeed exhibit such invariances, there are other important characteristics, such as encoding contextual reasoning skills, for which alternative reconstruction-based approaches might be better suited. With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn representations by training a convolutional net to reconstruct a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the student network (whose role is to learn representations), along with an online update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets). This idea effectively enables fully online BoW-guided unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the interest of our BoW-based strategy, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods (including contrastive-based ones) in several applications. For instance, in downstream tasks such Pascal object detection, Pascal classification and Places205 classification, our method improves over all prior unsupervised approaches, thus establishing new state-of-the-art results that are also significantly better even than those of supervised pre-training.

Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the RFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the semantic labels.

We think that superior forecasting can be achieved by decomposing a dynamic scene into individual 'things' and background 'stuff'. Background 'stuff' largely moves because of camera motion, while foreground 'things' move because of both camera and individual object motion. Following this decomposition, we introduce panoptic segmentation forecasting. Panoptic segmentation forecasting opens up a middle-ground between existing extremes, which either forecast instance trajectories or predict the appearance of future image frames. To address this task we develop a two-component model: one component learns the dynamics of the background stuff by anticipating odometry, the other one anticipates the dynamics of detected things.

To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a new auto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses towards a greater diversity and thus improve generalization of the trained 2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose augmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors (e.g., posture, body size, view point and position) of a pose through differentiable operations. With such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with the 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate more diverse and harder poses in an online manner. Moreover, PoseAug introduces a novel part-aware Kinematic Chain Space for evaluating local joint-angle plausibility and develops a discriminative module accordingly to ensure the plausibility of the augmented poses. These elaborate designs enable PoseAug to generate more diverse yet plausible poses than existing offline augmentation methods, and thus yield better generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is generic and easy to be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseAug brings clear improvements on both intra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets.

When developing computer vision models that can reason about compositional spatio-temporal events, we need benchmarks that can analyze progress and uncover shortcomings. Existing video question answering benchmarks are useful, but they often conflate multiple sources of error into one accuracy metric and have strong biases that models can exploit, making it difficult to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA), a new benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal reasoning. AGQA contains 192M unbalanced question answer pairs for 9.6K videos. We also provide a balanced subset of 3.9M question answer pairs, 3 orders of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks, that minimizes bias by balancing the answer distributions and types of question structures. Although human evaluators marked 86.02% of our question-answer pairs as correct, the best model achieves only 47.74% accuracy. In addition, AGQA introduces multiple training/test splits to test for various reasoning abilities, including generalization to novel compositions, to indirect references, and to more compositional steps. Using AGQA, we evaluate modern visual reasoning systems, demonstrating that the best models barely perform better than non-visual baselines exploiting linguistic biases and that none of the existing models generalize to novel compositions unseen during training.","citations":0,"title":"AGQA: A Benchmark for Compositional Spatio-Temporal Reasoning","twitter":{"likes":5,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1378379081914281984","1377345417873027074","1377254889655562250","1377160578775453699","1377104008641323015","1377073598171652106"]},"id":"124a3e86-eee5-5f38-b4ae-f24e7e04d55d","s2id":"cf2b945be7b695d01a9abc5b099c54d8cdabac2a","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Grunde-McLaughlin_AGQA_A_Benchmark_for_Compositional_Spatio-Temporal_Reasoning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Madeleine Grunde-McLaughlin","Ranjay Krishna","Maneesh Agrawala"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Estimating scene geometry from cost-effective sensors is key for robots.

To tackle this issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA semantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance the generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the capacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed DMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for different level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation.

The existing deep learning-based tracking algorithms use regular CNNs that are inherently translation equivariant, but not designed to tackle rotations. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in the presence of rotation instances in videos, the performance of existing trackers is severely affected. To circumvent the adverse effect of rotations, we present rotation-equivariant Siamese networks (RE-SiamNets), built through the use of group-equivariant convolutional layers comprising steerable filters. SiamNets allow estimating the change in orientation of the object in an unsupervised manner, thereby facilitating its use in relative 2D pose estimation as well. We further show that this change in orientation can be used to impose an additional motion constraint in Siamese tracking through imposing restriction on the change in orientation between two consecutive frames. For benchmarking, we present Rotation Tracking Benchmark (RTB), a dataset comprising a set of videos with rotation instances. Through experiments on two popular Siamese architectures, we show that RE-SiamNets handle the problem of rotation very well and outperform their regular counterparts. Further, RE-SiamNets can accurately estimate the relative change in pose of the target in an unsupervised fashion, namely the in-plane rotation the target has sustained with respect to the reference frame.","citations":0,"title":"Rotation Equivariant Siamese Networks for Tracking","twitter":{"likes":22,"replies":2,"retweets":5,"ids":["1366293766726971392","1343250536603258880","1343069180082466822","1342873063461892097","1342676816788680705","1342480345569091585","1342284263648092161"]},"id":"2b31d521-554a-54ba-b68c-39647ce4048f","s2id":"52f6d9cb1ed66d899cbc918e2228be6950e83739","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Gupta_Rotation_Equivariant_Siamese_Networks_for_Tracking_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Deepak K.

DARTS mainly focuses on the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS.

Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation information from the two feature maps (target and search region). However, DW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily be fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak discrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted parameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on large-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric convolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation information in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr and its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the convolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a concatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby avoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and height)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information, such as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr. To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three representative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN. Our experiments reveal the benefits of the proposed ACM, which outperforms existing methods on six tracking benchmarks.

Specifically, the temporal alignment loss (i.e., Soft-DTW) aims for the minimum cost for temporally aligning videos in the embedding space. However, optimizing solely for this term leads to trivial solutions, particularly, one where all frames get mapped to a small cluster in the embedding space. To overcome this problem, we propose a temporal regularization term (i.e., Contrastive-IDM) which encourages different frames to be mapped to different points in the embedding space. Extensive evaluations on various tasks, including action phase classification, action phase progression, and fine-grained frame retrieval, on three datasets, namely Pouring, Penn Action, and IKEA ASM, show superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art methods for self-supervised representation learning from videos. In addition, our method provides significant performance gain where labeled data is lacking.","citations":1,"title":"Learning by Aligning Videos in Time","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1377820411321143299","1379139525801357316","1377516222103740417"]},"id":"8b9053cf-60e7-54d6-bd21-b959f7a32921","s2id":"bcbdb67e861ed6afd99e6b88d73318d979fd87ac","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Haresh_Learning_by_Aligning_Videos_in_Time_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Sanjay Haresh","Sateesh Kumar","Huseyin Coskun","Shahram N.

Different from objects in natural images, aerial objects are often distributed with arbitrary orientation. Therefore, the detector requires more parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly redundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model the orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed to train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly encodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and lead to a huge reduction of model size. Based on the rotation-equivariant features, we also present Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align), which adaptively extracts rotation-invariant features from equivariant features according to the orientation of RoI. Extensive experiments on several challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016, show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of aerial object detection. Compared with previous best results, our ReDet gains 1.2, 3.5 and 2.6 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 respectively while reducing the number of parameters by 60% (313 Mb vs. 121 Mb).

The method begins with classic handcrafted techniques for segmenting objects using motion cues: we estimate optical flow and camera motion, and conservatively segment regions that appear to be moving independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors, under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of the \"moving\" type, even if they are not moving, and add these as new pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules generalize to yet-unlabelled data (during the M step). We compare against existing unsupervised object discovery and tracking methods, using challenging videos from CATER and KITTI, and show strong improvements over the state-of-the-art.","citations":0,"title":"Track, Check, Repeat: An EM Approach to Unsupervised Tracking","twitter":{"likes":18,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1380557618150801412","1381443003240251405"]},"id":"37a30449-2c1f-5277-9642-0db22e45e22e","s2id":"b5126ed0d46ef7af3663f60fcaacf1c503e4065d","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Harley_Track_Check_Repeat_An_EM_Approach_to_Unsupervised_Tracking_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Adam W.

Here we formalize a new type of jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are general convex polygons generated by cutting through a global polygonal shape with an arbitrary number of straight cuts. We analyze the theoretical properties of such puzzles, including the inherent challenges in solving them once pieces are contaminated with geometrical noise. To cope with such difficulties and obtain tractable solutions, we abstract the problem as a multi-body spring-mass dynamical system endowed with hierarchical loop constraints and a layered reconstruction process that is guided by the pictorial content of the pieces. We define evaluation metrics and present experimental results on both apictorial and pictorial puzzles to indicate that they are solvable completely automatically.","citations":null,"title":"Crossing Cuts Polygonal Puzzles: Models and Solvers","twitter":null,"id":"62c1e938-baa7-537f-900e-4a0c458b09d8","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Harel_Crossing_Cuts_Polygonal_Puzzles_Models_and_Solvers_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Peleg Harel","Ohad Ben-Shahar"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Humans live within a 3D space and constantly interact with it to perform tasks. Such interactions involve physical contact between surfaces that is semantically meaningful. Our goal is to learn how humans interact with scenes and leverage this to enable virtual characters to do the same. To that end, we introduce a novel Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) model that encodes proximal relationships, called POSA for \"Pose with prOximitieS and contActs\". The representation of interaction is body-centric, which enables it to generalize to new scenes. Specifically, POSA augments the SMPL-X parametric human body model such that, for every mesh vertex, it encodes (a) the contact probability with the scene surface and (b) the corresponding semantic scene label. We learn POSA with a VAE conditioned on the SMPL-X vertices, and train on the PROX dataset, which contains SMPL-X meshes of people interacting with 3D scenes, and the corresponding scene semantics from the PROX-E dataset. We demonstrate the value of POSA with two applications. First, we automatically place 3D scans of people in scenes. We use a SMPL-X model fit to the scan as a proxy and then find its most likely placement in 3D. POSA provides an effective representation to search for \"affordances\" in the scene that match the likely contact relationships for that pose. We perform a perceptual study that shows significant improvement over the state of the art on this task. Second, we show that POSA's learned representation of body-scene interaction supports monocular human pose estimation that is consistent with a 3D scene, improving on the state of the art.

Sewer pipes are manually inspected to determine whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by the number of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe. Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been limited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of public datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer defect classification called Sewer-ML. The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years. Together with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm and a novel metric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a result of evaluating 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, six from the sewer defect classification domain and six from the multi-label classification domain, and combining the best performing algorithms. The novel metric is a class-importance weighted F2 score, F2-CIW, reflecting the economic impact of each class, used together with the normal pipe F1 score, F1-Normal. The benchmark algorithm achieves an F2-CIW score of 55.11% and F1-Normal score of 90.94%, leaving ample room for improvement on the Sewer-ML dataset.

Therefore, it has been mainly used for offline methods. Volumetric fusion enables real-time scanning using a conventional RGB-D camera, but its geometry resolution has been limited by the grid resolution of the volumetric distance field and depth registration errors. In this paper, we propose a real-time scanning method that can acquire high-detail geometry by bridging volumetric fusion and multiview SfS in two steps. First, we propose the first real-time acquisition of photometric normals stored in texture space to achieve high-detail geometry. We also introduce geometry-aware texture mapping, which progressively refines geometric registration between the texture space and the volumetric distance field by means of normal texture, achieving real-time multiview SfS. We demonstrate our scanning of high-detail geometry using an RGB-D camera at  20 fps. Results verify that the geometry quality of our method is strongly competitive with that of offline multi-view SfS methods.","citations":null,"title":"NormalFusion: Real-Time Acquisition of Surface Normals for High-Resolution RGB-D Scanning","twitter":null,"id":"712a5c9b-98ff-5c93-b968-406ae4fd258b","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ha_NormalFusion_Real-Time_Acquisition_of_Surface_Normals_for_High-Resolution_RGB-D_Scanning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Hyunho Ha","Joo Ho Lee","Andreas Meuleman","Min H.

Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD achieves state-of-the-art visual place recognition results in computationally limited scenarios, validated on a range of challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. By combining superior performance with improved computational efficiency in a configurable framework, Patch-NetVLAD is well suited to enhance both stand-alone place recognition capabilities and the overall performance of SLAM systems.","citations":3,"title":"Patch-NetVLAD: Multi-Scale Fusion of Locally-Global Descriptors for Place Recognition","twitter":{"likes":93,"replies":3,"retweets":21,"ids":["1367268624923119616","1366574317287272451","1367004261062610946","1395611176122208256","1368072697444458497"]},"id":"d0225122-213a-5936-ab11-e3291c56bdd3","s2id":"c7a2b5cd46c0a3e51b5751dd3902d26aa2b02602","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Hausler_Patch-NetVLAD_Multi-Scale_Fusion_of_Locally-Global_Descriptors_for_Place_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Stephen Hausler","Sourav Garg","Ming Xu","Michael Milford","Tobias Fischer"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"We address the problem of computing a textural loss based on the statistics extracted from the feature activations of a convolutional neural network optimized for object recognition (e.g. VGG-19).

The datasets are collected with a simple adversarial filtration technique to create datasets with limited spurious cues. Our datasets' real-world, unmodified examples transfer to various unseen models reliably, demonstrating that computer vision models have shared weaknesses. The first dataset is called ImageNet-A and is like the ImageNet test set, but it is far more challenging for existing models. We also curate an adversarial out-of-distribution detection dataset called ImageNet-O, which is the first out-of-distribution detection dataset created for ImageNet models. On ImageNet-A a DenseNet-121 obtains around 2% accuracy, an accuracy drop of approximately 90%, and its out-of-distribution detection performance on ImageNet-O is near random chance levels. We find that existing data augmentation techniques hardly boost performance, and using other public training datasets provides improvements that are limited.

NCA learns to grow an image starting from a fixed single pixel. In this work, we show that the neural network (NN) architecture of the NCA can be encapsulated in a larger NN. This allows us to propose a new model that encodes a manifold of NCA, each of them capable of generating a distinct image. Therefore, we are effectively learning an embedding space of CA, which shows generalization capabilities. We accomplish this by introducing dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture, for the first time used to join two different sources of information, the encoding and cell's environment information. In biological terms, our approach would play the role of the transcription factors, modulating the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular differentiation, which occurs right before the morphogenesis. We thoroughly evaluate our approach in a dataset of synthetic emojis and also in real images of CIFAR-10.

Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent L2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a contextual feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting in much enhanced object appearance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO-Thing-Stuff and Visual Genome benchmarks.","citations":1,"title":"Context-Aware Layout to Image Generation With Enhanced Object Appearance","twitter":{"likes":12,"replies":1,"retweets":1,"ids":["1374174372018196482","1375664583025815552"]},"id":"ceb3c8e0-4536-53d8-8ea8-26e425667ce2","s2id":"cf8dd25f61803ff658d2572d2f5f9ba8c8d46fa1","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/He_Context-Aware_Layout_to_Image_Generation_With_Enhanced_Object_Appearance_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Sen He","Wentong Liao","Michael Ying Yang","Yongxin Yang","Yi-Zhe Song","Bodo Rosenhahn","Tao Xiang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11897"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recently, neural architecture search(NAS) has been applied to automatically search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search space usually contains a network topology level(controlling connections among cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level(operations within each cell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D image datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or single-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search efficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search. Our Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme(DiNTS) is evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challenging segmentation tasks.

The inevitable variation in the instance scales can lead bottom-up methods to become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we propose instead a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the instances. To make the kernels discriminative, we explore a large context by gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then decoded by several simple convolutional layers. Due to the limited receptive field introduced by the sparse convolution, a small light-weight transformer is also devised to capture the long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point samples. The proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and S3DIS, and this performance is robust to the particular hyper-parameter values chosen. It also improves inference speed by more than 25% over the current state-of-the-art.

Towards this end, we propose FFB6D, which learns to combine appearance and geometry information for representation learning as well as output representation selection. Specifically, at the representation learning stage, we build bidirectional fusion modules in the full flow of the two networks, where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. In this way, the two networks can leverage local and global complementary information from the other one to obtain better representations. Moreover, at the output representation stage, we designed a simple but effective 3D keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects, which simplifies keypoint localization for precise pose estimation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins on several benchmarks.

Despite achieving high performance, it is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen data. This is important because a practical detector should be ready to use in various scenarios in applications. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset evaluation. Through this study, we find that existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the same dataset, generalize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate that there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their designs (e.g. anchor settings) may be biased towards popular benchmarks in the traditional single-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their generalization capability. Secondly, the training source is generally not dense in pedestrians and diverse in scenarios. Under direct cross-dataset evaluation, surprisingly, we find that a general purpose object detector, without pedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better compared to existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Furthermore, we illustrate that diverse and dense datasets, collected by crawling the web, serve to be an efficient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection. Accordingly, we propose a progressive training pipeline and find that it works well for autonomous-driving oriented pedestrian detection. Consequently, the study conducted in this paper suggests that more emphasis should be put on cross-dataset evaluation for the future design of generalizable pedestrian detectors.

Thus, benchmarking and advancing digital forgery analysis have become a pressing issue. However, existing face forgery datasets either have limited diversity or only support coarse-grained analysis. To counter this emerging threat, we construct the ForgeryNet dataset, an extremely large face forgery dataset with unified annotations in image- and video-level data across four tasks: 1) Image Forgery Classification, including two-way (real / fake), three-way (real / fake with identity-replaced forgery approaches / fake with identity-remained forgery approaches), and n-way (real and 15 respective forgery approaches) classification. 2) Spatial Forgery Localization, which segments the manipulated area of fake images compared to their corresponding source real images. 3) Video Forgery Classification, which re-defines the video-level forgery classification with manipulated frames in random positions. This task is important because attackers in real world are free to manipulate any target frame. and 4) Temporal Forgery Localization, to localize the temporal segments which are manipulated. ForgeryNet is by far the largest publicly available deep face forgery dataset in terms of data-scale (2.9 million images, 221,247 videos), manipulations (7 image-level approaches, 8 video-level approaches), perturbations (36 independent and more mixed perturbations) and annotations (6.3 million classification labels, 2.9 million manipulated area annotations and 221,247 temporal forgery segment labels). We perform extensive benchmarking and studies of existing face forensics methods and obtain several valuable observations.We hope that the scale, quality, and variety of ForgeryNet dataset will foster further research and innovation in the area of face forgery classification, spatial and temporal forgery localization etc.","citations":0,"title":"ForgeryNet: A Versatile Benchmark for Comprehensive Forgery Analysis","twitter":{"likes":56,"replies":3,"retweets":9,"ids":["1369525074227720195","1369472843822546944","1370560954665218051","1369755253504172032","1369734568589201408","1369525177604861957","1369478315170488321"]},"id":"e2346a4b-902e-5124-8c3d-9dd5ffebe97f","s2id":"6dc46fde00ec139ee69054a0c9cff5285175cd2b","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/He_ForgeryNet_A_Versatile_Benchmark_for_Comprehensive_Forgery_Analysis_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Yinan He","Bei Gan","Siyu Chen","Yichun Zhou","Guojun Yin","Luchuan Song","Lu Sheng","Jing Shao","Ziwei Liu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05630"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Data association across frames is at the core of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task. This problem is usually solved by a traditional graph-based optimization or directly learned via deep learning. Despite their popularity, we find some points worth studying in current paradigm: 1) Existing methods mostly ignore the context information among tracklets and intra-frame detections, which makes the tracker hard to survive in challenging cases like severe occlusion. 2) The end-to-end association methods solely rely on the data fitting power of deep neural networks, while they hardly utilize the advantage of optimization-based assignment methods. 3) The graph-based optimization methods mostly utilize a separate neural network to extract features, which brings the inconsistency between training and inference. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel learnable graph matching method to address these issues. Briefly speaking, we model the relationships between tracklets and the intra-frame detections as a general undirected graph. Then the association problem turns into a general graph matching between tracklet graph and detection graph. Furthermore, to make the optimization end-to-end differentiable, we relax the original graph matching into continuous quadratic programming and then incorporate the training of it into a deep graph network with the help of the implicit function theorem.

In addition, similar to the setting of unsupervised domain adaptation, unlabeled target domain data is leveraged to further improve the performance of domain adaptation. This is achieved by additionally constraining the outputs of multiple adaptation models with pseudo labels online generated by an ensembled model. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the widely-used domain adaptation benchmark datasets in semantic segmentation.

Our method relies on the observation that this type of natural motion can be convincingly reproduced from a static Eulerian motion description, i.e. a single, temporally constant flow field that defines the immediate motion of a particle at a given 2D location. We use an image-to-image translation network to encode motion priors of natural scenes collected from online videos, so that for a new photo, we can synthesize a corresponding motion field. The image is then animated using the generated motion through a deep warping technique: pixels are encoded as deep features, those features are warped via Eulerian motion, and the resulting warped feature maps are decoded as images. In order to produce continuous, seamlessly looping video textures, we propose a novel video looping technique that flows features both forward and backward in time and then blends the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by applying it to a large collection of examples including beaches, waterfalls, and flowing rivers.","citations":2,"title":"Animating Pictures With Eulerian Motion Fields","twitter":{"likes":2948,"replies":130,"retweets":686,"ids":["1333583632682733570","1333693426064191489","1384587032173875200","1404891487159173120","1333583687187714050","1333583662223220736","1405171953866924037","1384632153292492801","1333583705328160768","1404593776824180737","1404513255234498560","1365533476712157187","1384644975346991110","1393091243656232960","1335860330488975361","1365918116060958720","1333890369512230912","1333612477485961218","1333603510558986240","1333592193257398272","1365966276728819713","1390958119065427969","1333698727245189120","1335162002487058432","1335761621709287424","1384899253143756808","1338182091771506688"]},"id":"1c40c383-35cd-5c27-a4c5-5aff172bcf98","s2id":"a9eb5c59763b5da7a9a0e1c5ef543b2f02630feb","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Holynski_Animating_Pictures_With_Eulerian_Motion_Fields_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Aleksander Holynski","Brian L.

Some significant features for identification are embedded in unobvious body shape differences across pedestrians. To explore such body shape cues for cloth-changing Re-ID, we propose a Fine-grained Shape-Appearance Mutual learning framework (FSAM), a two-stream framework that learns fine-grained discriminative body shape knowledge in a shape stream and transfers it to an appearance stream to complement the cloth-unrelated knowledge in the appearance features. Specifically, in the shape stream, FSAM learns fine-grained discriminative mask with the guidance of identities and extracts fine-grained body shape features by a pose-specific multi-branch network. To complement cloth-unrelated shape knowledge in the appearance stream, dense interactive mutual learning is performed across low-level and high-level features to transfer knowledge from shape stream to appearance stream, which enables the appearance stream to be deployed independently without extra computation for mask estimation.

The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, we achieve 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI, outperforming 2nd place by 2.6% in terms of the PQ metric.","citations":1,"title":"LiDAR-Based Panoptic Segmentation via Dynamic Shifting Network","twitter":{"likes":41,"replies":0,"retweets":3,"ids":["1334004307125882880","1333367392689217537","1331623791139692544","1334160615754108928","1333964335761272833","1331427631267540992"]},"id":"66937164-9fbb-52ca-8287-dbc3c08dde92","s2id":"7af77f8a95abfac03383519efb471d0a8582139a","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Hong_LiDAR-Based_Panoptic_Segmentation_via_Dynamic_Shifting_Network_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Fangzhou Hong","Hui Zhou","Xinge Zhu","Hongsheng Li","Ziwei Liu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11964"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Panoptic segmentation is a challenging task aiming to simultaneously segment objects (things) at instance level and background contents (stuff) at semantic level.

To simplify the pipeline and decrease computation/memory cost, we propose an one-stage approach called Lightweight Panoptic Segmentation Network (LPSNet), which does not involve proposal, anchor or mask head. Instead, we predict bounding box and semantic category at each pixel upon the feature map produced by an augmented feature pyramid, and design a parameter-free head to merge the per-pixel bounding box and semantic prediction into panoptic segmentation output. Our LPSNet is not only efficient in computation and memory, but also accurate in panoptic segmentation.

The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of state driven visual reasoning approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e. Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View.

Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead.

However, the requirement of large amounts of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision limits the wide use of these models. Although there have been a few attempts in training an image denoising model with only single noisy images, existing self-supervised denoising approaches suffer from inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or dependence on noise modeling. In this paper, we present a very simple yet effective method named Neighbor2Neighbor to train an effective image denoising model with only noisy images. Firstly, a random neighbor sub-sampler is proposed for the generation of training image pairs. In detail, input and target used to train a network are images sub-sampled from the same noisy image, satisfying the requirement that paired pixels of paired images are neighbors and have very similar appearance with each other. Secondly, a denoising network is trained on sub-sampled training pairs generated in the first stage, with a proposed regularizer as additional loss for better performance. The proposed Neighbor2Neighbor framework is able to enjoy the progress of state-of-the-art supervised denoising networks in network architecture design. Moreover, it avoids heavy dependence on the assumption of the noise distribution. We explain our approach from a theoretical perspective and further validate it through extensive experiments, including synthetic experiments with different noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world experiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space.","citations":1,"title":"Neighbor2Neighbor: Self-Supervised Denoising From Single Noisy Images","twitter":{"likes":26,"replies":3,"retweets":6,"ids":["1348556463761809409","1348737359622230022","1373662828045893640","1348823244640374784","1348656133074870275","1373667700405383178","1373656941163995138","1349018666185220096","1348822346996527106","1348640978278690817","1348459696429137923"]},"id":"fdeb6581-2b72-51c8-b4d7-4a69966b947a","s2id":"94080d9344523abe3730c383c41ef2311d591c6e","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Huang_Neighbor2Neighbor_Self-Supervised_Denoising_From_Single_Noisy_Images_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Tao Huang","Songjiang Li","Xu Jia","Huchuan Lu","Jianzhuang Liu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02824"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present MultiBodySync, a novel, end-to-end trainable multi-body motion segmentation and rigid registration framework for multiple input 3D point clouds.

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by proposing a group-based OOD detection framework, along with a novel OOD scoring function termed MOS. Our key idea is to decompose the large semantic space into smaller groups with similar concepts, which allows simplifying the decision boundaries between in- vs. out-of-distribution data for effective OOD detection. Our method scales substantially better for high-dimensional class space than previous approaches. We evaluate models trained on ImageNet against four carefully curated OOD datasets, spanning diverse semantics.

In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts -- inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.

We examined domain variance and invariance property of FCs statistically and designed a network that can identify and fuse DIFs and DVFs dynamically through iterative learning.

In this paper, we address this problem by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we propose to learn Motion from Static Images (MoSI). The model learns to encode motion information by classifying pseudo motions generated by MoSI. We furthermore introduce a static mask in pseudo motions to create local motion patterns, which forces the model to additionally locate notable motion areas for the correct classification.We demonstrate that MoSI can discover regions with large motion even without fine-tuning on the downstream datasets. As a result, the learned motion representations boost the performance of tasks requiring understanding of complex scenes and motions, i.e., action recognition.

Therefore, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first decompose the mixed face features into two uncorrelated components---identity- and age-related features---through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption. In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance AIFR and FAS.

This solution always involves more computational costs to bring about time-consuming inference. At present, most blind SR algorithms are dedicated to obtaining high-fidelity results; their loss function generally employs L1 loss. To further improve the visual quality of SR results, perceptual metric, such as NIQE, is necessary to guide the network optimization. However, due to the non-differentiable property of NIQE, it cannot be as the loss function. Towards these issues, we propose an adaptive modulation network (AMNet) for multiple degradations SR, which is composed of the pivotal adaptive modulation layer (AMLayer). It is an efficient yet lightweight fusion layer between blur kernel and image features. Equipped with the blur kernel predictor, we naturally upgrade the AMNet to the blind SR model. Instead of considering iterative strategy, we make the blur kernel predictor trainable in the whole blind SR model, in which AMNet is well-trained. Also, we fit deep reinforcement learning into the blind SR model (AMNet-RL) to tackle the non-differentiable optimization problem. Specifically, the blur kernel predictor will be the actor to estimate the blur kernel from the input low-resolution (LR) image. The reward is designed by the pre-defined differentiable or non-differentiable metric.

In this work, we explore future freespace as an alternative representation to support motion planning. Our key intuition is that it is important to avoid straying into occupied space regardless of what is occupying it. Importantly, computing ground-truth future freespace is annotation-free. First, we explore freespace forecasting as a self-supervised learning task. We then demonstrate how to use forecasted freespace to identify collision-prone plans from off-the-shelf motion planners. Finally, we propose future freespace as an additional source of annotation-free supervision. We demonstrate how to integrate such supervision into the learning-based planners. Experimental results on nuScenes and CARLA suggest both approaches lead to a significant reduction in collision rates.","citations":null,"title":"Safe Local Motion Planning With Self-Supervised Freespace Forecasting","twitter":null,"id":"3e7b0aca-df96-5996-905b-8cfbc4ecc4d4","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Hu_Safe_Local_Motion_Planning_With_Self-Supervised_Freespace_Forecasting_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Peiyun Hu","Aaron Huang","John Dolan","David Held","Deva Ramanan"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Extracting detailed 3D information of objects from video data is an important goal for holistic scene understanding.

Furthermore, it is difficult to add spatial supervision into the generation process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector provided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness (since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes).

We propose a novel intensity cue based on measuring inter-photon timing, defined as the time delay between detection of successive photons. Based on the statistics of inter-photon times measured by a time-resolved single-photon sensor, we develop theory and algorithms for a scene brightness estimator which works over extreme dynamic range; we experimentally demonstrate imaging scenes with a dynamic range of over ten million to one. The proposed techniques, aided by the emergence of single-photon sensors such as single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with picosecond timing resolution, will have implications for a wide range of imaging applications: robotics, consumer photography, astronomy, microscopy and biomedical imaging.","citations":0,"title":"Passive Inter-Photon Imaging","twitter":{"likes":171,"replies":1,"retweets":52,"ids":["1379994781309235204"]},"id":"8fab8e5a-33e2-5966-8550-b409ecfba390","s2id":"f3998025773eb3d8cc577b30c89af840c86ff109","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ingle_Passive_Inter-Photon_Imaging_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Atul Ingle","Trevor Seets","Mauro Buttafava","Shantanu Gupta","Alberto Tosi","Mohit Gupta","Andreas Velten"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00059"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Explainability of deep learning methods is imperative to facilitate their clinical adoption in digital pathology. However, popular deep learning methods and explainability techniques (explainers) based on pixel-wise processing disregard biological entities' notion, thus complicating comprehension by pathologists. In this work, we address this by adopting biological entity-based graph processing and graph explainers enabling explanations accessible to pathologists. In this context, a major challenge becomes to discern meaningful explainers, particularly in a standardized and quantifiable fashion. To this end, we propose herein a set of novel quantitative metrics based on statistics of class separability using pathologically measurable concepts to characterize graph explainers. We employ the proposed metrics to evaluate three types of graph explainers, namely the layer-wise relevance propagation, gradient-based saliency, and graph pruning approaches, to explain Cell-Graph representations for Breast Cancer Subtyping. The proposed metrics are also applicable in other domains by using domain-specific intuitive concepts. We validate the qualitative and quantitative findings on the BRACS dataset, a large cohort of breast cancer RoIs, by expert pathologists.

A key-values memory structure, with a set of read/update operations, is introduced to record class-wise style variations and access them without requiring an object detector at the test time. The key stores a domain-agnostic content representation for allocating memory items, while the values encode domain-specific style representations. We also present a feature contrastive loss to boost the discriminative power of memory items.

Each component is represented by a latent code via a trained encoder. To model the motion, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is trained to update the initial state conditioned on the learned motion code, and a decoder takes the shape code and the updated state code to reconstruct the 3D model at each time stamp.

Since OSR requires rich data and FSL considers closed-set classification, existing OSR and FSL methods show poor performances in solving FSOSR problems.

Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C^ 2 -Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C^ 2 -Matching significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.

Recently, adversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the robustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the next few frames to initialize temporal motion attacks. We validate the proposed IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based, correlation filter based, and long-term trackers). Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IoU attack method.

One simple idea is to use the leave-one-out error of each training point to indicate its importance. Recent work has also proposed to use the Shapley value, as it defines a unique value distribution scheme that satisfies a set of appealing properties. However, calculating Shapley values is often expensive, which limits its applicability in real-world applications at scale. Multiple heuristics to improve the scalability of calculating Shapley values have been proposed recently, with the potential risk of compromising their utility in real-world applications. How well do existing data quantification methods perform on existing workflows? How do these methods compare with each other, empirically and theoretically? Must we sacrifice scalability for the utility in these workflows when using these methods? In this paper, we conduct a novel theoretical analysis comparing the utility of different importance quantification methods, and report extensive experimental studies on settings such as noisy label detection, watermark removal, data summarization, data acquisition, and domain adaptation on existing and proposed workflows. We show that Shapley value approximation based on a KNN surrogate over pre-trained feature embeddings obtains comparable utility with existing algorithms while achieving significant scalability improvement, often by orders of magnitude.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a \"locate-then-segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight network.

On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-arts methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

Through experiments, we observe that a higher frequency, and hence a smaller pixel displacement between consecutive frames, tends to deliver favorable super-resolved results. This discovery motivates us to introduce Event Cameras, a novel sensing device that responds instantly to pixel intensity changes and produces up to millions of asynchronous events per second, to facilitate VSR. To this end, we propose an Event-based VSR framework (E-VSR), of which the key component is an asynchronous interpolation (EAI) module that reconstructs a high-frequency (HF) video stream with uniform and tiny pixel displacements between neighboring frames from an event stream. The derived HF video stream is then encoded into a VSR module to recover the desired HR videos.

The desired MR image and coil sensitivity maps can be obtained by sequentially estimating them with two blocks based on the unrolled network architecture. To demonstrate the performance of Joint-ICNet, we performed experiments with a fastMRI brain dataset for two reduction factors (R = 4 and 8).

However, they can recreate training images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators. However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur, compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators. However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression, we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ.

These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower, bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in shallow DoF rendering.","citations":null,"title":"Unsupervised\n Learning of Depth and Depth-of-Field Effect From Natural Images With \nAperture Rendering Generative Adversarial Networks","twitter":null,"id":"689fb953-1d9f-5f93-9683-0dcc52563b35","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Kaneko_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Depth_and_Depth-of-Field_Effect_From_Natural_Images_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Takuhiro Kaneko"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"In unsupervised learning of image features without labels, especially on datasets with fine-grained object classes, it is often very difficult to tell if a given image belongs to one specific object class or another, even for human eyes.

Extensive evaluation of the proposed method on the challenging subjects generally shows comparable or better results than the supervised and classical approaches.","citations":0,"title":"Uncalibrated Neural Inverse Rendering for Photometric Stereo of General Surfaces","twitter":{"likes":52,"replies":2,"retweets":7,"ids":["1380496115938816005","1380086992453697536","1340905255488241666","1378798716660908036","1339007516923973632","1338690347719856130","1378799033100206081","1355113615611686916","1338871893936525313","1338675373056303105"]},"id":"2ab2df74-3ad9-5fad-aaca-efadbda490fe","s2id":"7718d74845248d46c611882b43982f10ae545a0f","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Kaya_Uncalibrated_Neural_Inverse_Rendering_for_Photometric_Stereo_of_General_Surfaces_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Berk Kaya","Suryansh Kumar","Carlos Oliveira","Vittorio Ferrari","Luc Van Gool"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06777"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Novel view synthesis is a challenging and ill-posed inverse rendering problem.

We adopt high-capacity neural scene representations with periodic activations for jointly optimizing an implicit surface and a radiance field of a scene supervised exclusively with posed 2D images. Our neural rendering pipeline accelerates SOTA neural volume rendering by about two orders of magnitude and our implicit surface representation is unique in allowing us to export a mesh with view-dependent texture information. Thus, like other implicit surface representations, ours is compatible with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling real-time rendering rates, while achieving unprecedented image quality compared to other surface methods.

In this paper, we claim that the standard evaluation metric, which consists in measuring the overall in-domain accuracy, is misleading. Since questions and concepts are unbalanced, this tends to favor models which exploit subtle training set statistics. Alternatively, naively introducing artificial distribution shifts between train and test splits is also not completely satisfying. First, the shifts do not reflect real-world tendencies, resulting in unsuitable models; second, since the shifts are handcrafted, trained models are specifically designed for this particular setting, and do not generalize to other configurations. We propose the GQA-OOD benchmark designed to overcome these concerns: we measure and compare accuracy over both rare and frequent question-answer pairs, and argue that the former is better suited to the evaluation of reasoning abilities, which we experimentally validate with models trained to more or less exploit biases. In a large-scale study involving 7 VQA models and 3 bias reduction techniques, we also experimentally demonstrate that these models fail to address questions involving infrequent concepts and provide recommendations for future directions of research.","citations":7,"title":"Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue... but Should VQA Expect Them To?","twitter":{"likes":28,"replies":3,"retweets":10,"ids":["1270990770707759104","1271053567831552000","1270902332973297665","1270893590374473734","1380304840081895431","1380153742499184647","1379991226795974657","1379987648874356736","1379972541985529864","1336697413969567744","1336501145741750273","1271206090789867521","1271180537483403271","1271075084409724928","1270975099370450944","1270898197511073793"]},"id":"9758e2b8-604a-5163-bb50-1072d79dea26","s2id":"95cb3e6b628a3a0220b8c80fde4f9f4a3d2e7221","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Kervadec_Roses_Are_Red_Violets_Are_Blue..._but_Should_VQA_Expect_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Corentin Kervadec","Grigory Antipov","Moez Baccouche","Christian Wolf"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05121"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Since its inception, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is notoriously known as a task, where models are prone to exploit biases in datasets to find shortcuts instead of performing high-level reasoning.

In this paper, we argue that uncertainty in vision is a dominating factor preventing the successful learning of reasoning in vision and language problems. We train a visual oracle and in a large scale study provide experimental evidence that it is much less prone to exploiting spurious dataset biases compared to standard models. We propose to study the attention mechanisms at work in the visual oracle and compare them with a SOTA Transformer-based model. We provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of reasoning patterns obtained with an online visualization tool which we make publicly available (https://reasoningpatterns.github.io). We exploit these insights by transferring reasoning patterns from the oracle to a SOTA Transformer-based VQA model taking standard noisy visual inputs via fine-tuning.

We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons' contribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an L2-ball), a property that we use for proposing a feature attribution method: \"pathway gradient\".

Therefore, in existing works common practice is also to report Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) -- the results of human evaluation of super-resolved images. Unfortunately, the MOS values from different papers are not directly comparable, due to the varying number of raters, their subjectivity, etc. By this paper, we introduce Neural Side-By-Side -- a new measure that allows super-resolution models to be compared automatically, effectively approximating human preferences. Namely, we collect a large dataset of aligned image pairs, which were produced by different super-resolution models. Then each pair is annotated by several raters, who were instructed to choose a more visually appealing image. Given the dataset and the labels, we trained a CNN model that obtains a pair of images and for each image predicts a probability of being more preferable than its counterpart. In this work, we show that Neural Side-By-Side generalizes across both new models and new data. Hence, it can serve as a natural approximation of human preferences, which can be used to compare models or tune hyperparameters without raters' assistance.

This memory is utilized for finding matches between tracks and detections, and is updated based on the matching. Many approaches model each target in isolation and lack the ability to use all the targets in the scene to jointly update the memory. This can be problematic when there are similarly looking objects in the scene. In this paper, we solve the problem of simultaneously considering all tracks during memory updating, with only a small spatial overhead, via a novel multi-track pooling module. We additionally propose a training strategy adapted to multi-track pooling which generates hard tracking episodes online. We show that the combination of these innovations results in a strong discriminative appearance model under the bilinear LSTM tracking framework, enabling the use of greedy data association to achieve online tracking performance.

This work proposes a novel, intuitive loss function called the CAM-consistency loss, which improves the consistency of an input image in image translation. While the existing cycle-consistency loss ensures that the image can be translated back, our approach makes the model further preserve the attribute-irrelevant regions even in a single translation to another domain by using the Grad-CAM output computed from the discriminator. Our CAM-consistency loss directly optimizes such a Grad-CAM output from the discriminator during training, in order to properly capture which local regions the generator should change while keeping the other regions unchanged. In this manner, our approach allows the generator and the discriminator to collaborate with each other to improve the image translation quality.

In contrast, we propose a robust estimator for primitive fitting, which can meaningfully abstract real-world environments using cuboids. A RANSAC estimator guided by a neural network fits these primitives to 3D features, such as a depth map. We condition the network on previously detected parts of the scene, thus parsing it one-by-one.

Recent research suggests that generative adversarial networks have the ability to overcome this limitation and serve as a multi-modal loss, especially for textures. Together with learned image compression, these two techniques can be used to great effect when relaxing the commonly employed tight measures of distortion. However, convolutional neural network-based algorithms have a large computational footprint. Ideally, an existing conventional codec should stay in place, ensuring faster adoption and adherence to a balanced computational envelope. As a possible avenue to this goal, we propose and investigate how learned image coding can be used as a surrogate to optimise an image for encoding. A learned filter alters the image to optimise a different performance measure or a particular task. Extending this idea with a generative adversarial network, we show how entire textures are replaced by ones that are less costly to encode but preserve a sense of detail. Our approach can remodel a conventional codec to adjust for the MS-SSIM distortion with over 20% rate improvement without any decoding overhead. On task-aware image compression, we perform favourably against a similar but codec-specific approach.","citations":0,"title":"How To Exploit the Transferability of Learned Image Compression to Conventional Codecs","twitter":{"likes":2,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1335602360085741568","1334907957331443714","1369312283927715850","1369137591786770436","1369115950579089409","1335655608624812033","1335474320345272331","1335277972618612738","1335262762830757888","1335081663269920769","1334885313156673541","1334689161777999878"]},"id":"b9ad0311-1ec4-52e8-8ac3-7a5b5af63dca","s2id":"8c9e6e5ad185a99e4beec3a9cd66f86b6d428dfb","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Klopp_How_To_Exploit_the_Transferability_of_Learned_Image_Compression_to_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Jan P.

The large images are usually decomposed into small sub-images in practical usages. Based on this processing, we found that different image regions have different restoration difficulties and can be processed by networks with different capacities. Intuitively, smooth areas are easier to super-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt appropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the decomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- ClassSR that combines classification and SR in a unified framework. In particular, it first uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes according to restoration difficulties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR for different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification network, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the to-be-accelerated SR network and its simplified versions. We further introduce a new classification method with two losses -- Class-Loss and Average-Loss to produce the classification results. After joint training, a majority of sub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can be significantly reduced. Experiments show that our ClassSR can help most existing methods (e.g., FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, RCAN) save up to 50% FLOPs on DIV8K datasets.

The quantization of weights and feature maps (activations) is a popular approach to solve this problem. Training-aware quantization often shows excellent results but requires a full dataset, which is not always available. Post-training quantization methods, in turn, are applied without fine-tuning but still work well for many classes of tasks like classification, segmentation, and so on. However, they either imply a big overhead for quantization parameters (QPs) calculation at runtime (dynamic methods) or lead to an accuracy drop if pre-computed static QPs are used (static methods). Moreover, most inference frameworks don't support dynamic quantization. Thus we propose a novel quantization approach called QPP: quantization parameter prediction. With a small subset of a training dataset or unlabeled data from the same domain, we find the predictor that can accurately estimate QPs of activations given only the NN's input data. Such a predictor allows us to avoid complex calculation of precise values of QPs while maintaining the quality of the model. To illustrate our method's efficiency, we added QPP into two dynamic approaches: 1) Dense+Sparse quantization, where the predetermined percentage of activations are not quantized, 2) standard quantization with equal quantization steps.

The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from the input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection.

Nevertheless, due to the limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information while not losing self-awareness.

Most methods use the straight-through estimator (STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by replacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of an identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown decent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the same gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and outputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient scaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a quantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given a gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each gradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer input to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed depending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the continuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling factor adaptively using Hessian information of a network. We show extensive experimental results on the image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with diverse network architectures under a wide range of bit-width settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.","citations":0,"title":"Network Quantization With Element-Wise Gradient Scaling","twitter":null,"id":"fdd577e7-1474-54ea-9c5c-c3c1c7ac5242","s2id":"5590ca49c1fd9487a844368ac1c7760912bc65e9","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Lee_Network_Quantization_With_Element-Wise_Gradient_Scaling_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Junghyup Lee","Dohyung Kim","Bumsub Ham"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00903"}},{"node":{"abstract":"With increasing fields of application for neural networks and the development of neural networks, the ability to explain deep learning models is also becoming increasingly important.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving object alignment (SIPSA-Net) which is the first method to take into account such large misalignment of moving object regions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment module (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even between the two different PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in pan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which ignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the same effect as optimizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image.

Experiments on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that CLIPBERT outperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length videos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled clips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from full-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle.

However, they fail to fully exploit the general SR kernel assumption that anisotropic Gaussian kernels are sufficient for image SR. To address this issue, this paper proposes a normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel modeling. By learning an invertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a tractable latent distribution, FKP can be easily used to replace the kernel modeling modules of Double-DIP and KernelGAN. Specifically, FKP optimizes the kernel in the latent space rather than the network parameter space, which allows it to generate reasonable kernel initialization, traverse the learned kernel manifold and improve the optimization stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed FKP can significantly improve the kernel estimation accuracy with less parameters, runtime and memory usage, leading to state-of-the-art blind SR results.","citations":0,"title":"Flow-Based Kernel Prior With Application to Blind Super-Resolution","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1402978184463667203"]},"id":"77d428a8-8b63-5bad-aea0-026c0921e071","s2id":"ccbb9a0c11f707bd15611f0b3f227cf7a8040876","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Liang_Flow-Based_Kernel_Prior_With_Application_to_Blind_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Jingyun Liang","Kai Zhang","Shuhang Gu","Luc Van Gool","Radu Timofte"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15977"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich but heterogeneous domain to a label-scare domain, which alleviates the labeling efforts and attracts considerable attention. Different from previous methods focusing on learning domain-invariant feature representations, some recent methods present generic semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques and directly apply them to DA tasks, even achieving competitive performance. One of the most popular SSL techniques is pseudo-labeling that assigns pseudo labels for each unlabeled data via the classifier trained by labeled data. However, it ignores the distribution shift in DA problems and is inevitably biased to source data. To address this issue, we propose a new pseudo-labeling framework called Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC). ATDOC alleviates the classifier bias by introducing an auxiliary classifier for target data only, to improve the quality of pseudo labels. Specifically, we employ the memory mechanism and develop two types of non-parametric classifiers, i.e. the nearest centroid classifier and neighborhood aggregation, without introducing any additional network parameters. Despite its simplicity in a pseudo classification objective, ATDOC with neighborhood aggregation significantly outperforms domain alignment techniques and prior SSL techniques on a large variety of DA benchmarks and even scare-labeled SSL tasks.","citations":0,"title":"Domain Adaptation With Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier","twitter":{"likes":10,"replies":2,"retweets":1,"ids":["1303834253147475968","1281222133063049219","1281047938056290304","1281040474384498689","1338886901684531200","1338675457793921024","1338872007732105222","1281221871191691267","1281116103733698560","1281065331205775360"]},"id":"ba697a01-55fe-5ad0-bb3c-7fa84b0a90a1","s2id":"b4fe9d6b018d820a82b0710d312af84b585a695b","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Liang_Domain_Adaptation_With_Auxiliary_Target_Domain-Oriented_Classifier_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Jian Liang","Dapeng Hu","Jiashi Feng"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04171"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been exploited to design feature pyramid networks (FPNs) and achieved promising results for visual object detection.

In this paper, we present an efficient and effective 3D object detection framework, named RangeIoUDet that uses the range image as input. Benefiting from the dense representation of the range image, RangeIoUDet is entirely constructed based on 2D convolution, making it possible to have a fast inference speed.

We optimize the pointwise feature and the 3D box via the point-based IoU and box-based IoU supervision, respectively. The point-based IoU supervision is proposed to make the network better learn the implicit 3D information encoded in the range image. The 3D Hybrid GIoU loss is introduced to generate high-quality boxes while providing an accurate quality evaluation. Through the point-based IoU and the box-based IoU, RangeIoUDet outperforms all single-stage models on the KITTI dataset, while running at 45 FPS for inference.

Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling.

In this paper, we investigate efficient annotation strategies for collecting multi-class classification labels for a large collection of images. While methods that exploit learnt models for labeling exist, a surprisingly prevalent approach is to query humans for a fixed number of labels per datum and aggregate them, which is expensive. Building on prior work on online joint probabilistic modeling of human annotations and machine-generated beliefs, we propose modifications and best practices aimed at minimizing human labeling effort.

However, due to the high computational cost of large-scale generators (e.g., StyleGAN2), it usually takes seconds to see the results of a single edit on edge devices, prohibiting interactive user experience. In this paper, inspired by quick preview features in modern rendering software, we propose Anycost GAN for interactive natural image editing. We train the Anycost GAN to support elastic resolutions and channels for faster image generation at versatile speeds. Running subsets of the full generator produce outputs that are perceptually similar to the full generator, making them a good proxy for a quick preview. By using sampling-based multi-resolution training, adaptive-channel training, and a generator-conditioned discriminator, the anycost generator can be evaluated at various configurations while achieving better image quality compared to separately trained models. Furthermore, we develop new encoder training and latent code optimization techniques to encourage consistency between the different sub-generators during image projection. Anycost GAN can be executed at various cost budgets (up to 10x computation reduction) and adapt to a wide range of hardware and latency requirements. When deployed on desktop CPUs and edge devices, our model can provide perceptually similar previews at 6-12x speedup, enabling interactive image editing. The code and demo are publicly available.","citations":2,"title":"Anycost GANs for Interactive Image Synthesis and Editing","twitter":{"likes":160,"replies":6,"retweets":41,"ids":["1367662344667545600","1368331441545768962","1368989019825086466","1368518901928062980","1369248740280778754","1373394210905325577","1367736671517765634","1372544568365772810","1367755012156317696","1379779746268131330","1379779490482544647","1371054503328239617","1370329484201754625","1368071244197806085","1367731660339302400"]},"id":"358d3118-ee01-5fe8-9f83-76618546a519","s2id":"43d9627fdf1436d827788cd95105112a57b53696","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Lin_Anycost_GANs_for_Interactive_Image_Synthesis_and_Editing_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Ji Lin","Richard Zhang","Frieder Ganz","Song Han","Jun-Yan Zhu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03243"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Artistic style transfer aims at migrating the style from an example image to a content image. Currently, optimization-based methods have achieved great stylization quality, but expensive time cost restricts their practical applications. Meanwhile, feed-forward methods still fail to synthesize complex style, especially when holistic global and local patterns exist. Inspired by the common painting process of drawing a draft and revising the details, we introduce a novel feed-forward method Laplacian Pyramid Network (LapStyle). LapStyle first transfers global style pattern in low-resolution via a Drafting Network. It then revises the local details in high-resolution via a Revision Network, which hallucinates a residual image according to the draft and the image textures extracted by Laplacian filtering. Higher resolution details can be easily generated by stacking Revision Networks with multiple Laplacian pyramid levels. The final stylized image is obtained by aggregating outputs of all pyramid levels.

However, as it is only based on a general context integration operation and does not consider any specific glass surface properties, it gets confused when the images contain objects that are similar to glass surfaces and degenerates in challenging scenes with insufficient contexts. We observe that humans often rely on identifying reflections in order to sense the existence of glass and on locating the boundary in order to determine the extent of the glass. Hence, we propose a model for glass surface detection, which consists of two novel modules: (1) a rich context aggregation module (RCAM) to extract multi-scale boundary features from rich context features for locating glass surface boundaries of different sizes and shapes, and (2) a reflection-based refinement module (RRM) to detect reflection and then incorporate it so as to differentiate glass regions from non-glass regions. In addition, we also propose a challenging dataset consisting of 4,012 glass images with annotations for glass surface detection.

Envision that you are instructed by a high-level instruction, \"Go to the bathroom in the master bedroom and replace the blue towel on the left wall\", what would you possibly do to carry out the task? Intuitively, we comprehend the semantics of the instruction to form an overview of where a bathroom is and what a blue towel is in mind; then, we navigate to the target location by consistently matching the bathroom appearance in mind with the current scene. In this paper, we present an agent that mimics such human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on the Remote Embodied Visual Referring Expression in Real Indoor Environments task, called REVERIE, where an agent is asked to correctly localize a remote target object specified by a concise high-level natural language instruction, and propose a two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, we pre-train the agent with two cross-modal alignment sub-tasks, namely the Scene Grounding task and the Object Grounding task.

Our work has three novel contributions. First, we distill 3D knowledge from a pretrained 3D network to supervise a 2D network to learn simulated 3D features from 2D features during the training, so the 2D network can infer without requiring 3D data. Second, we design a two-stage dimension normalization scheme to calibrate the 2D and 3D features for better integration. Third, we design a semantic-aware adversarial training model to extend our framework for training with unpaired 3D data.

However, a stylized photograph is not quite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually meaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in scenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer.

While prior works mainly accelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing state-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2 by 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size model.

On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules: Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to generate the final reports.

Different from contextual reasoning which focuses on feature aggregation in the spatial domain, visual dependency reasoning explicitly models the dependency relations among visual entities. In this paper, we introduce a novel network architecture, termed the dependency network or DependencyNet, for semantic segmentation. It unifies dependency reasoning at three semantic levels. Intra-class reasoning decouples the representations of different object categories and updates them separately based on the internal object structures. Inter-class reasoning then performs spatial and semantic reasoning based on the dependency relations among different object categories. We will have an in-depth investigation on how to discover the dependency graph from the training annotations. Global dependency reasoning further refines the representations of each object category based on the global scene information. Extensive ablative studies with a controlled model size and the same network depth show that each individual dependency reasoning component benefits semantic segmentation and they together significantly improve the base network.

One fundamental challenge lies in how to leverage numerous real 2D images without any 3D ground truth. To address this issue, we take an alternative approach with semi-supervised learning. That is, for a 2D image of a generic object, we decompose it into latent representations of category, shape and albedo, lighting and camera projection matrix, decode the representations to segmented 3D shape and albedo respectively, and fuse these components to render an image well approximating the input image. Using a category-adaptive 3D joint occupancy field (JOF), we show that the complete shape and albedo modeling enables us to leverage real 2D images in both modeling and model fitting.

It was believed that the success lies in the high-level perceptual feature representations extracted from CNNs pretrained with a large set of images. Here we reveal that what matters is the network structure instead of the trained weights. Without any learning, the structure of a deep network is sufficient to capture the dependencies between multiple levels of variable statistics using multiple layers of CNNs. This insight removes the requirements of pre-training and a particular network structure (commonly, VGG) that are previously assumed for the perceptual loss, thus enabling a significantly wider range of applications. To this end, we demonstrate that a randomly-weighted deep CNN can be used to model the structured dependencies of outputs. On a few dense per-pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and instance segmentation, we show improved results of using the extended randomized perceptual loss, compared to the baselines using pixel-wise loss alone.

Modeling motion coherence on sparse putative correspondences is challenging due to their sparsity and uneven distributions. Existing works on motion coherence are sensitive to parameter settings and have difficulty in dealing with complex motion patterns. In this paper, we introduce a network called Laplacian Motion Coherence Network (LMCNet) to learn motion coherence property for correspondence pruning. We propose a novel formulation of fitting coherent motions with a smooth function on a graph of correspondences and show that this formulation allows a closed-form solution by graph Laplacian. This closed-form solution enables us to design a differentiable layer in a learning framework to capture global motion coherence from putative correspondences. The global motion coherence is further combined with local coherence extracted by another local layer to robustly detect inlier correspondences.

Such detection paradigm also encounters the mismatch between classification and localization due to the inherent discrepancy of their optimization targets. In this work, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm for harmoniously learning to rank and localize proposals in lieu of the classification task. To this end, we comprehensively investigate three types of ranking constraints, i.e., global ranking, class-specific ranking and IoU-guided ranking losses. The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher than background. The class-specific ranking loss ensures that positive samples rank higher than negative ones for each specific class. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align each pair of confidence scores with the associated pair of IoU overlap between two positive samples of a specific class. Our ranking constraints can sufficiently explore the relationships between samples from three different perspectives. They are easy-to-implement, compatible with mainstream detection frameworks and computation-free for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our RankDetNet consistently surpasses prior anchor-based and anchor-free baselines, e.g., improving RetinaNet baseline by 2.5% AP on the COCO test-dev set without bells and whistles.

Randomized smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image classifiers.

Our first major theoretical contribution is that we show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded.

To achieve zero-short model quantization without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for diverse data generation.

However, an implicit contradiction about reconstruction and classification is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to precisely reconstruct novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be close to those of novel classes (min-margin). On the other hand, to perform accurate classification, the distributions of either two classes must be far away from each other (max-margin). In this paper, we propose a class margin equilibrium (CME) approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic way. CME first converts the few-shot detection problem to the few-shot classification problem by using a fully connection layer to decouple localization features.

In order to utilize neighboring sharp patches, typical methods rely mainly on homography or optical flows to spatially align neighboring blurry frames. However, such explicit approaches are less effective in the presence of fast motions with large pixel displacements. In this work, we propose a novel implicit method to learn spatial correspondence among blurry frames in the feature space. To construct distant pixel correspondences, our model builds a correlation volume pyramid among all the pixel-pairs between neighboring frames. To enhance the features of the reference frame, we design a correlative aggregation module that maximizes the pixel-pair correlations with its neighbors based on the volume pyramid. Finally, we feed the aggregated features into a reconstruction module to obtain the restored frame. We design a generative adversarial paradigm to optimize the model progressively. Our proposed method is evaluated on the widely-adopted DVD dataset, along with a newly collected High-Frame-Rate (1000 fps) Dataset for Video Deblurring (HFR-DVD).

Previous works treat the private samples in the target as one generic class but ignore their intrinsic structure. Consequently, the resulting representations are not compact enough in the latent space and can be easily confused with common samples. To better exploit the intrinsic structure of the target domain, we propose Domain Consensus Clustering(DCC), which exploits the domain consensus knowledge to discover discriminative clusters on both common samples and private ones. Specifically, we draw the domain consensus knowledge from two aspects to facilitate the clustering and the private class discovery, i.e., the semantic-level consensus, which identifies the cycle-consistent clusters as the common classes, and the sample-level consensus, which utilizes the cross-domain classification agreement to determine the number of clusters and discover the private classes. Based on DCC, we are able to separate the private classes from the common ones, and differentiate the private classes themselves. Finally, we apply a class-aware alignment technique on identified common samples to minimize the distribution shift, and a prototypical regularizer to inspire discriminative target clusters.

The difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few instances.

However, such a static model is difficult to handle conflicts across multiple domains, and suffers from a performance degradation in both source domains and target domain. In this paper, we present dynamic transfer to address domain conflicts, where the model parameters are adapted to samples. The key insight is that adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across samples. Thus, it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into a single source domain.

Though recent works have reached sound achievements, there are still unignorable problems: a) learned features supervised by softmax loss are separable but not discriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and interclass separability; and b) fixed filter banks and hand-crafted features are insufficient to capture forgery patterns of frequency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limitations, a novel frequency-aware discriminative feature learning framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a novel single-center loss (SCL) that only compresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting interclass differences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more discriminative features with less optimization difficulty. Besides, an adaptive frequency feature generation module is developed to mine frequency clues in a completely data-driven fashion. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discriminative features in an end-to-end manner.

As a common practice, most existing methods predict LQE scores through vanilla convolutional features shared with object classification or bounding box regression. In this paper, we explore a completely novel and different perspective to perform LQE -- based on the learned distributions of the four parameters of the bounding box. The bounding box distributions are inspired and introduced as \"General Distribution\" in GFLV1, which describes the uncertainty of the predicted bounding boxes well. Such a property makes the distribution statistics of a bounding box highly correlated to its real localization quality. Specifically, a bounding box distribution with a sharp peak usually corresponds to high localization quality, and vice versa. By leveraging the close correlation between distribution statistics and the real localization quality, we develop a considerably lightweight Distribution-Guided Quality Predictor (DGQP) for reliable LQE based on GFLV1, thus producing GFLV2. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in object detection to use a highly relevant, statistical representation to facilitate LQE. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network.

In contrast, we propose the first approach suitable for both structured and unstructured scenes. Instead of geometric constraint, we leverage the spatial regularity on sphere. Specifically, we propose to map line correspondences into vectors tangent to sphere. We use these vectors to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines, which is more reliable and concise than directly using inclinations, midpoints or endpoints of image lines. Neighboring vectors mapped from correct matches exhibit a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the type of scenes. To encode this regularity, we design a neural network and also propose a novel loss function that enforces the smoothness constraint of vector field. In addition, we establish a large real-world dataset for image line matching.

Modeling data uncertainty is essential for regression, especially in unconstrained settings. Traditionally the direct regression formulation is considered and the uncertainty is modeled by modifying the output space to a certain family of probabilistic distributions. On the other hand, classification based regression and ranking based solutions are more popular in practice while the direct regression methods suffer from the limited performance. How to model the uncertainty within the present-day technologies for regression remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose to learn probabilistic ordinal embeddings which represent each data as a multivariate Gaussian distribution rather than a deterministic point in the latent space.

In light of this, most existing methods for unsupervised domain adaptation focus on achieving domain-invariant representations and small source domain error. However, recent works have shown that this is not sufficient to guarantee good generalization on target domain and in fact is provably detrimental under label distribution shift. Furthermore, in many real-world applications it is often feasible to obtain a small amount of labeled data from the target domain and use them to facilitate model training with source data. Inspired by the above observations, in this paper we propose the first method that aims to simultaneously learn invariant representations and risks under the setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (Semi-DA). To start with, we first give a finite sample bound for both classification and regression problems under Semi-DA. The bound suggests a principled way for target generalization by aligning both the marginal and conditional distributions across domains in feature space. Motivated by this, we then introduce our LIRR algorithm for jointly Learning Invariant Representations and Risks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of LIRR. Compared with methods that only learn invariant representations or invariant risks, LIRR achieves significant improvements.","citations":4,"title":"Learning Invariant Representations and Risks for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation","twitter":{"likes":11,"replies":2,"retweets":2,"ids":["1315530641253990402","1316056475580747779","1315912347484000256","1315663787744165888","1315489840280944640","1315478292670017537","1315467489749471232","1315950659401728000","1315860197609439238","1315819744126140417","1315483490549366784"]},"id":"f41d7be2-6e3b-5389-bf5c-ee417c254b84","s2id":"758fb62a9ce0cabfce71b0020a662522ca8ceabf","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Li_Learning_Invariant_Representations_and_Risks_for_Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaptation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Bo Li","Yezhen Wang","Shanghang Zhang","Dongsheng Li","Kurt Keutzer","Trevor Darrell","Han Zhao"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04647"}},{"node":{"abstract":"LiDAR-based 3D detection in point cloud is essential in the perception system of autonomous driving.

Importantly, given that ISDA estimates the class-conditional statistics to obtain semantic directions, we find it ineffective to do this on minority classes due to the insufficient training data. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn transformed semantic directions with meta-learning automatically.

This task is challenging due to large intra-class variations and a severe lack of ground truth. A popular solution is to learn correspondences from synthetic data. However, because of the limited intra-class appearance and background variations within synthetically generated training data, the model's capability for handling \"real\" image pairs using such strategy is intrinsically constrained. We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy -- the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision. Again, we observe the superiority of our PMD.

To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the FPN framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency. In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object boundaries, respectively. The former samples salient points while the latter samples points from the object boundaries.

In the self-supervised manner, establishing correspondences between two point clouds to approximate scene flow is an effective approach. Previous methods often obtain correspondences by applying point-wise matching that only takes the distance on 3D point coordinates into account, introducing two critical issues: (1) it overlooks other discriminative measures, such as color and surface normal, which often bring fruitful clues for accurate matching; and (2) it often generates sub-par performance, as the matching is operated in an unconstrained situation, where multiple points can be ended up with the same corresponding point. To address the issues, we formulate this matching task as an optimal transport problem. The output optimal assignment matrix can be utilized to guide the generation of pseudo ground truth. In this optimal transport, we design the transport cost by considering multiple descriptors and encourage one-to-one matching by mass equality constraints. Also, constructing a graph on the points, a random walk module is introduced to encourage the local consistency of the pseudo labels.

First, convolutional features are neither aligned with anchor boxes nor with ground-truth bounding boxes, reducing the mask sensitivity to spatial location. Second, a video is directly divided into individual frames for frame-level instance segmentation, ignoring the temporal correlation between adjacent frames. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage video instance segmentation framework by spatial calibration and temporal fusion, namely STMask. To ensure spatial feature calibration with ground-truth bounding boxes, we first predict regressed bounding boxes around ground-truth bounding boxes, and extract features from them for frame-level instance segmentation. To further explore temporal correlation among video frames, we aggregate a temporal fusion module to infer instance masks from each frame to its adjacent frames, which helps our framework to handle challenging videos such as motion blur, partial occlusion and unusual object-to-camera poses. Experiments on the YouTube-VIS valid set show that the proposed STMask with ResNet-50/-101 backbone obtains 33.5 % / 36.8 % mask AP, while achieving 28.6 / 23.4 FPS on video instance segmentation.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp supervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to generate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a confidence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases.

Most existing domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature representations across two domains with the guidance of a shared source-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the generalization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we propose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the classifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features towards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep feature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as meaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features can be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more transferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the inter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance to construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source features with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely. Interestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source distribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and minimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and general technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation methods, bringing remarkable improvements.

Theoretically, we propose the Conditional Kernel Bures (CKB) metric for characterizing conditional distribution discrepancy, and derive an empirical estimation for the CKB metric without introducing the implicit kernel feature map. It provides an interpretable approach to understand the knowledge transfer mechanism. The established consistency theory of the empirical estimation provides a theoretical guarantee for convergence.

While the input image can be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method can reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person's face in neutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition. Cutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face models combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of a person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures which is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for integration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to work is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D faces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt a highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear morphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate detailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a perceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to cope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We further introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination photogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people with neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions.

We utilize a metric based on distance correlation to quantify the distribution bias from the metadata and demonstrate that our method successfully removes metadata effects on four diverse settings: one synthetic, one 2D image, one video, and one 3D medical image dataset.","citations":null,"title":"Metadata Normalization","twitter":{"likes":165,"replies":15,"retweets":54,"ids":["1384396211248013312","822214576871788544","1226080021242142720","614893879960035328","445936709084401664","1189315356382388225","1014115991343820800","932695390343741442","445941306825912320","1381718117445820420","1200050418753196032","1390684420445769729","350293757129789441","604273616226795520","5770121055","596285115937857537","1384859828292657156","1341191028934512642","1175147433409556490","1301571203870621697","950070154490101760","5758817259","179395714294611968","596270563607326721","596270563565432832","372769345769721856","1259022367","320384542760374272","255701702173417473","116690688573325312","163718928961511424","73328071515705344","73326339792449537","5796400304","5790900506","5772004089","596291533076312065","5757653439","5770891436","598436580429139968","598392205489741824","598392495597363200","1331633609183277056","1151882979997868032","878251450371100674","823991065799696386","795663121444732928","742797915815477249","700788439168499712","623130387036901376","605131131827003392","603199791334457344","599299791651250177","598628825476440065","598599958799917057","598449999127556096","598447521145298944","1386506033208594437","598428790629507072","598411643790426112","598402799529955328","598392500232007680","598392498109702144","797090560"]},"id":"1fa93bca-a35c-58bb-b28f-12263adda30d","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Lu_Metadata_Normalization_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Mandy Lu","Qingyu Zhao","Jiequan Zhang","Kilian M.

A lot of efforts have been made to model the compatibility between fashion items. Some have also studied users' personal preferences for the outfits. There is, however, another difficulty in the task that hasn't been dealt with carefully by previous work. Users that are new to the system usually only have several (less than 5) outfits available for learning. With such a limited number of training examples, it is challenging to model the user's preferences reliably. In this work, we propose a new solution for personalized outfit recommendation that is capable of handling this case. We use a stacked self-attention mechanism to model the high-order interactions among the items. We then embed the items in an outfit into a single compact representation within the outfit space. To accommodate the variety of users' preferences, we characterize each user with a set of anchors, i.e. a group of learnable latent vectors in the outfit space that are the representatives of the outfits the user likes. We also learn a set of general anchors to model the general preference shared by all users. Based on this representation of the outfits and the users, we propose a simple but effective strategy for the new user profiling tasks.

We take a step towards solving this novel problem of automatically associating objects with their effects in video. Given an ordinary video and a rough segmentation mask over time of one or more subjects of interest, we estimate an omnimatte for each subject -- an alpha matte and color image that includes the subject along with all its related time-varying scene elements. Our model is trained only on the input video in a self-supervised manner, without any manual labels, and is generic -- it produces omnimattes automatically for arbitrary objects and a variety of effects.

The asynchrony across modalities increases the difficulty on conducting efficient multimodal fusion. Hence, this work mainly focuses on multimodal fusion from unaligned multimodal sequences. To this end, we propose the Progressive Modality Reinforcement (PMR) approach based on the recent advances of crossmodal transformer. Our approach introduces a message hub to exchange information with each modality. The message hub sends common messages to each modality and reinforces their features via crossmodal attention. In turn, it also collects the reinforced features from each modality and uses them to generate a reinforced common message. By repeating the cycle process, the common message and the modalities' features can progressively complement each other. Finally, the reinforced features are used to make predictions for human emotion.

Common camouflage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, disguising body outlines. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged objects, we present the first ranking based COD network to simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the camouflaged objects. And, the ranking model infers the detectability of different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models.

First, a fusion stage reduces the noise through a recursive combination of all past frames in the video. Then, a denoising stage removes the noise in the fused frame. Finally, a refinement stage restores the missing high frequency in the denoised frame. All stages operate on a transform-domain representation obtained by learnable and invertible linear operators which simultaneously increase accuracy and decrease complexity of the model. A single loss on the final output is sufficient for successful convergence, hence making EMVD easy to train. Experiments on real raw data demonstrate that EMVD outperforms the state of the art when complexity is constrained, and even remains competitive against methods whose complexities are several orders of magnitude higher.

In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which avoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, by proposing mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different variants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and delegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed and parallel training. The proposed Skip-sideways achieves low latency training, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting temporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on real-world video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the large-scale Kinetics600. Finally, we also show that models trained with Skip-sideways generate better future frames than Sideways models, and hence they can better utilize motion cues.","citations":null,"title":"Gradient Forward-Propagation for Large-Scale Temporal Video Modelling","twitter":null,"id":"0bdd3c96-8f22-5015-985b-3b917f9b6b19","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Malinowski_Gradient_Forward-Propagation_for_Large-Scale_Temporal_Video_Modelling_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Mateusz Malinowski","Dimitrios Vytiniotis","Grzegorz Swirszcz","Viorica Patraucean","Joao Carreira"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Human pose transfer has received great attention due to its wide applications, yet is still a challenging task that is not well solved. Recent works have achieved great success to transfer the person image from the source to the target pose. However, most of them cannot well capture the semantic appearance, resulting in inconsistent and less realistic textures on the reconstructed results. To address this issue, we propose a new two-stage framework to handle the pose and appearance translation. In the first stage, we predict the target semantic parsing maps to eliminate the difficulties of pose transfer and further benefit the latter translation of per-region appearance style. In the second one, with the predicted target semantic maps, we suggest a new person image generation method by incorporating the region-adaptive normalization, in which it takes the per-region styles to guide the target appearance generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed SPGNet can generate more semantic, consistent, and photo-realistic results and perform favorably against the state of the art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates the ROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their filters. Moreover, with the strong representation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and makes FCPose have almost constant inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image. For example, on the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone infers about 4.5 times faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) (41.67 FPS vs. 9.26 FPS) while achieving improved performance (64.8% AP vs. 64.3% AP).

In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% w.r.t. the current state of the art.

This would ultimately result in drift from the target object when missing some parts of the target object. Recently, Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown promising results for image classification benefits from its part-object relationships mechanism, while CapsNet is known for its high computational demand even when carrying out simple tasks. Therefore, a primitive adaptation of CapsNet to regression tracking does not make sense, since this will seriously affect speed of a tracker. To solve these problems, we first explore the spatial-temporal relationships endowed by the CapsNet for regression tracking. The entire regression framework, dubbed CapsuleRRT, consists of three parts. One is S-Caps, which captures the spatial relationships between the parts and the object. Meanwhile, a T-Caps module is designed to exploit the temporal relationships within the target. The response of the target is obtained by STCaps Learning. Further, a prior-guided capsule routing algorithm is proposed to generate more accurate capsule assignments for subsequent frames. Apart from this, the heavy computation burden in CapsNet is addressed with a knowledge distillation pose matrix compression strategy that exploits more tight and discriminative representation with few samples.

The state-of-the-art methods often rely on context modeling methods such as pictorial structure model (PSM) or graph neural network (GNN) to reduce ambiguity. However, there is no study that rigorously compares them side by side. So we first present a general formula for context modeling in which both PSM and GNN are its special cases. By comparing the two methods, we found that the end-to-end training scheme in GNN and the limb length constraints in PSM are two complementary factors to improve results. To combine their advantages, we propose ContextPose based on attention mechanism that allows enforcing soft limb length constraints in a deep network. The approach effectively reduces the chance of getting absurd 3D pose estimates with incorrect limb lengths and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. More importantly, the introduction of limb length constraints into deep networks enables the approach to achieve much better generalization performance.","citations":0,"title":"Context Modeling in 3D Human Pose Estimation: A Unified Perspective","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1380033025711304709","1378204147871256579"]},"id":"e7640890-1696-5b86-a23f-f967657db024","s2id":"c2cb17e35548191597159ba062687416c19ac4a7","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ma_Context_Modeling_in_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_A_Unified_Perspective_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Xiaoxuan Ma","Jiajun Su","Chunyu Wang","Hai Ci","Yizhou Wang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15507"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Estimating 3D bounding boxes from monocular images is an essential component in autonomous driving, while accurate 3D object detection from this kind of data is very challenging. In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the `localization error' is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector. Lastly, we also propose a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for the size estimation of the object, which is not affected by `localization error'. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, where the proposed method achieves real-time detection and outperforms previous methods by a large margin.

In the black-box setting, current model stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model. Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called \"Simulator\", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity. Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the baseline method.

To enable learning, the choice of representation is the key. Recent work uses neural networks to parameterize local surface elements. This approach captures locally coherent geometry and non-planar details, can deal with varying topology, and does not require registered training data. However, naively using such methods to model 3D clothed humans fails to capture fine-grained local deformations and generalizes poorly. To address this, we present three key innovations: First, we deform surface elements based on a human body model such that large-scale deformations caused by articulation are explicitly separated from topological changes and local clothing deformations. Second, we address the limitations of existing neural surface elements by regressing local geometry from local features, significantly improving the expressiveness. Third, we learn a pose embedding on a 2D parameterization space that encodes posed body geometry, improving generalization to unseen poses by reducing non-local spurious correlations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our surface representation by learning models of complex clothing from point clouds. The clothing can change topology and deviate from the topology of the body. Once learned, we can animate previously unseen motions, producing high-quality point clouds, from which we generate realistic images with neural rendering.

Frame-level activations are then used for localization. However, the absence of frame-level annotations cause the classifier to impart class bias on every frame.

In contrast, we directly model the style variability of images, independent of the image synthesis task. Specifically, we pre-train a generic style encoder using a novel proxy task to learn an embedding of images, from arbitrary domains, into a low-dimensional style latent space. The learned latent space introduces several advantages over previous traditional approaches to multi-modal I2I translation. First, it is not dependent on the target dataset, and generalizes well across multiple domains. Second, it learns a more powerful and expressive latent space, which improves the fidelity of style capture and transfer.

Prior work alleviates this issue by either monitoring the face quality in pre-processing or predicting the data uncertainty along with the face feature. This paper proposes MagFace, a category of losses that learn a universal feature embedding whose magnitude before normalization can measure with the quality of the given face. Under the new loss, it can be proven that the magnitude of the feature embedding monotonically increases if the subject is more likely to be recognized. In addition, MagFace introduces an adaptive mechanism to learn a well-structured within-class feature distributions by pushing easy samples to class centers while pushing hard samples away. This prevents models from overfitting on noisy low-quality samples and improves face recognition in the wild. Extensive experiments conducted on face recognition, quality assessments as well as clustering have demonstrated the effectiveness of MagFace over state-of-the-arts.

To utilize the Huber loss, a parameter that controls the transitions from a quadratic function to an absolute value function needs to be selected. We believe the standard probabilistic interpretation that relates the Huber loss to the Huber density fails to provide adequate intuition for identifying the transition point. As a result, a hyper-parameter search is often necessary to determine an appropriate value. In this work, we propose an alternative probabilistic interpretation of the Huber loss, which relates minimizing the loss to minimizing an upper-bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Laplace distributions, where one distribution represents the noise in the ground-truth and the other represents the noise in the prediction. In addition, we show that the parameters of the Laplace distributions are directly related to the transition point of the Huber loss. We demonstrate, through a toy problem, that the optimal transition point of the Huber loss is closely related to the distribution of the noise in the ground-truth data. As a result, our interpretation provides an intuitive way to identify well-suited hyper-parameters by approximating the amount of noise in the data, which we demonstrate through a case study and experimentation on the Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet object detectors.","citations":14,"title":"An Alternative Probabilistic Interpretation of the Huber Loss","twitter":{"likes":20,"replies":3,"retweets":4,"ids":["1192259178175303681","1329615609114529792","1329797443958042624","1192595903837683712","1330627358336933888","1329978187875373056","1329993049435480065","1192270511264407553","1192272848926232577","1192273808985657344","1192277394524168192","1192278411277787138","1192432048667017218","1192451750348898304","1330370705461039106","1192616127781691392","1192712213032624129","1330566854646050816","1253204576917876737","1253317852121239552","1253333122684313601","1330174357012963330","1253121531644960768"]},"id":"a30996e4-4c21-5c84-a512-920d03d5be84","s2id":"327b155ab8e0c065f9f51e7f12ecc28bd68efdc1","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Meyer_An_Alternative_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_the_Huber_Loss_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Gregory P.

The pixel-level annotations are provided at a high frame rate of 15 f/s. 3) High resolution. Over 96% of the captured videos are with high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4K. We totally annotate 3,337 videos, including 239,934 frames from 124 categories. To the best of our knowledge, our VSPW is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VSPW, we design a generic Temporal Context Blending (TCB) network, which can effectively harness long-range contextual information from the past frames to help segment the current one. Extensive experiments show that our TCB network improves both the segmentation performance and temporal stability comparing with image-/video-based state-of-the-art methods.

Unlike image where the context information is distributed evenly over the object, most LiDAR points are distributed along the object boundary, which means the boundary features are more critical in LiDAR points 3D detection. However, quantization inevitably introduces ambiguity during both the training and inference stages. To alleviate this problem, we propose a one-stage and voting-based 3D detector, named Point-Voxel-Grid Network (PVGNet). In particular, PVGNet extracts point, voxel and grid-level features in a unified backbone architecture and produces point-wise fusion features. It segments LiDAR points into foreground and background, predicts a 3D bounding box for each foreground point, and performs group voting to get the final detection results. Moreover, we observe that instance-level point imbalance due to occlusion and observation distance also degrades the detection performance. A novel instance-aware focal loss is proposed to alleviate this problem and further improve the detection ability. We conduct experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets.

With this in mind, the descriptions people generate for videos of different dynamic events can greatly improve our understanding of the key information of interest in each video. These descriptions can be captured in captions that provide expanded attributes for video labeling (e.g. actions/objects/scenes/sentiment/etc.) while allowing us to gain new insight into what people find important or necessary to summarize specific events.

Toward this goal, we introduce Asynchronous-Sparse Interaction Graph Networks (ASSIGN), a recurrent graph network that is able to automatically detect the structure of interaction events associated with entities in a video scene. ASSIGN pioneers learning of autonomous behavior of video entities including their dynamic structure and their interaction with the coexisting neighbors. Entities' lives in our model are asynchronous to those of others therefore more flexible in adapting to complex scenarios. Their interactions are sparse in time hence more faithful to the true underlying nature and more robust in inference and learning.

First, audio-visual correspondences often produce faulty positives since the audio and video signals can be uninformative of each other. To limit the detrimental impact of faulty positives, we optimize a weighted contrastive learning loss, which down-weighs their contribution to the overall loss. Second, since self-supervised contrastive learning relies on random sampling of negative instances, instances that are semantically similar to the base instance can be used as faulty negatives. To alleviate the impact of faulty negatives, we propose to optimize an instance discrimination loss with a soft target distribution that estimates relationships between instances.

Accordingly, in geometry processing, maps are ubiquitous and are used in many core applications, such as paramterization, shape analysis, remeshing, and deformation. Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps do not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing hard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need. In this paper, we advocate to consider neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with respect to distortion measures. We show that our formulation enables trivial optimization of rather elusive mapping tasks, such as maps between a collection of surfaces.","citations":0,"title":"Neural Surface Maps","twitter":{"likes":38,"replies":1,"retweets":6,"ids":["1377435120089501697","1378152589309607939","1378202009866809344","1377632213198594048","1377450825866444805","1377435809968578564"]},"id":"2d836367-792e-5edb-bf75-c67ac824f904","s2id":"191a14be3c977d958da731c98383cc2c90d12da5","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Morreale_Neural_Surface_Maps_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Luca Morreale","Noam Aigerman","Vladimir G.

We find that state-of-the-art approaches for training on imbalanced datasets do not produce accurate deep models in this regime. Our solution is to split the large, visually diverse background into many smaller, visually similar categories during training. We implement this idea by extending an image classification model with an additional auxiliary loss that learns to mimic the predictions of a pre-existing classification model on the training set. The auxiliary loss requires no additional human labels and regularizes feature learning in the shared network trunk by forcing the model to discriminate between auxiliary categories for all training set examples, including those belonging to the monolithic background of the main rare category classification task. To evaluate our method we contribute modified versions of the iNaturalist and Places365 datasets where only a small subset of rare category labels are available during training (all other images are labeled as background). By jointly learning to recognize both the selected rare categories and auxiliary categories, our approach yields models that perform 8.3 mAP points higher than state-of-the-art imbalanced learning baselines when 98.30% of the data is background, and up to 42.3 mAP points higher than fine-tuning baselines when 99.98% of the data is background.","citations":0,"title":"Background Splitting: Finding Rare Classes in a Sea of Background","twitter":{"likes":2,"replies":0,"retweets":1,"ids":["1300798569151164416","1300899265166954497","1300790726066921472","1300619576980332550","1300609432997552129"]},"id":"10042d77-eb57-5f8f-9887-ed0c62c35516","s2id":"c226e57f7bc35427310e1b4c559a94579ef45e69","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Mullapudi_Background_Splitting_Finding_Rare_Classes_in_a_Sea_of_Background_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Ravi Teja Mullapudi","Fait Poms","William R.

Our key insight is that inferring the complete geometry of the objects significantly helps in tracking. By hallucinating unseen regions of objects, we can obtain additional correspondences between the same instance, thus providing robust tracking even under strong change of appearance. From a sequence of RGB-D frames, we detect objects in each frame and learn to predict their complete object geometry as well as a dense correspondence mapping into a canonical space. This allows us to derive 6DoF poses for the objects in each frame, along with their correspondence between frames, providing robust object tracking across the RGB-D sequence.

Recent studies suggest that one of the main causes of this problem is CNNs' strong inductive bias towards image styles (i.e. textures) which are sensitive to domain changes, rather than contents (i.e. shapes). Inspired by this, we propose to reduce the intrinsic style bias of CNNs to close the gap between domains. Our Style-Agnostic Networks (SagNets) disentangle style encodings from class categories to prevent style biased predictions and focus more on the contents. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively reduces the style bias and makes the model more robust under domain shift.

It relies on iteratively using the model to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled data to train against. A common property among its various methods is that they only rely on the model's prediction to make labeling decisions without considering any prior knowledge about the visual similarity among the classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that this degrades the quality of pseudo-labeling as it poorly represents visually similar classes in the pool of pseudo-labeled data. We propose SemCo, a method which leverages label semantics and co-training to address this problem. We train two classifiers with two different views of the class labels: one classifier uses the one-hot view of the labels and disregards any potential similarity among the classes, while the other uses a distributed view of the labels and groups potentially similar classes together. We then co-train the two classifiers to learn based on their disagreements. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL tasks including 5.6% accuracy improvement on Mini-ImageNet dataset with 1000 labeled examples.

ProtoTree combines prototype learning with decision trees, and thus results in a globally interpretable model by design. Additionally, ProtoTree can locally explain a single prediction by outlining a decision path through the tree. Each node in our binary tree contains a trainable prototypical part. The presence or absence of this learned prototype in an image determines the routing through a node. Decision making is therefore similar to human reasoning: Does the bird have a red throat? And an elongated beak? Then it's a hummingbird! We tune the accuracy-interpretability trade-off using ensemble methods, pruning and binarizing. We apply pruning without sacrificing accuracy, resulting in a small tree with only 8 learned prototypes along a path to classify a bird from 200 species.

Several recent successful methods for training deep neural networks (DNNs) robust to label noise have used two primary techniques: filtering samples based on loss during a warm-up phase to curate an initial set of cleanly labeled samples, and using the output of a network as a pseudo-label for subsequent loss calculations. In this paper, we evaluate different augmentation strategies for algorithms tackling the \"\"learning with noisy labels\"\" problem. We propose and examine multiple augmentation strategies and evaluate them using synthetic datasets based on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as on the real-world dataset Clothing1M. Due to several commonalities in these algorithms, we find that using one set of augmentations for loss modeling tasks and another set for learning is the most effective, improving results on the state-of-the-art and other previous methods. Furthermore, we find that applying augmentation during the warm-up period can negatively impact the loss convergence behavior of correctly versus incorrectly labeled samples. We introduce this augmentation strategy to the state-of-the-art technique and demonstrate that we can improve performance across all evaluated noise levels.

Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample i and the corresponding activations of the sample p(i), thus swapping statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such as shape or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability p and the identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect's strength. With the correct choice of p, fixed apriori for all experiments and selected without considering test data, our method consistently outperforms baselines in multiple settings.

Existing live vision pipelines tackle this fundamental challenge by relying on high dynamic range (HDR) sensors that try to recover HDR images from multiple captures with different exposures. While HDR sensors substantially increase the dynamic range, they are not without disadvantages, including severe artifacts for dynamic scenes, reduced fill-factor, lower resolution, and high sensor cost. At the same time, traditional auto-exposure methods for low-dynamic range sensors have advanced as proprietary methods relying on image statistics separated from downstream vision algorithms. In this work, we revisit auto-exposure control as an alternative to HDR sensors. We propose a neural network for exposure selection that is trained jointly, end-to-end with an object detector and an image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. To this end, we use an HDR dataset for automotive object detection and an HDR training procedure. We validate that the proposed neural auto-exposure control, which is tailored to object detection, outperforms conventional auto-exposure methods by more than 6 points in mean average precision (mAP).","citations":0,"title":"Neural Auto-Exposure for High-Dynamic Range Object Detection","twitter":null,"id":"8015ceaf-d025-592e-a728-9d476d187204","s2id":"e02ca875cb8f23d5ebb7c9bb666634fbea6216a2","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Onzon_Neural_Auto-Exposure_for_High-Dynamic_Range_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Emmanuel Onzon","Fahim Mannan","Felix Heide"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images.

For this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and the recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the sample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score, which only considers the partial information from the intra-class. However, these methods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for estimating the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality pseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDD-FIQA surpasses the state-of-the-arts by an impressive margin.

Finally, the projected target is used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target.

To this end, we design an Actor-Context-Actor Relation Network (ACAR-Net) which builds upon a novel High-order Relation Reasoning Operator and an Actor-Context Feature Bank to enable indirect relation reasoning for spatio-temporal action localization. Experiments on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show the advantages of modeling actor-context-actor relations, and visualization of attention maps further verifies that our model is capable of finding relevant higher-order relations to support action detection. Notably, our method ranks first in the AVA-Kinetics action localization task of ActivityNet Challenge 2020, outperforming other entries by a significant margin (+6.71 mAP).

While prior works struggle to localize objects by various spatial regularization strategies, we argue that how to extract object structural information from the trained classification network is neglected. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach, termed structure-preserving activation (SPA), towards fully leveraging the structure information incorporated in convolutional features for WSOL. In the first stage, a restricted activation module (RAM) is designed to alleviate the structure-missing issue caused by the classification network, based on the observation that the unbounded classification map and global average pooling layer drive the network to focus only on object parts. In the second stage, we propose a post-process approach, termed the self-correlation map generating (SCG) module to obtain structure-preserving localization maps on the basis of the activation maps acquired from the first stage. Specifically, we utilize the high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent structural information retained in the learned model and then aggregate HSC of multiple points for precise object localization. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmarks including CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC show that the proposed SPA achieves substantial and consistent performance gains compared with baseline approaches.","citations":0,"title":"Unveiling the Potential of Structure Preserving for Weakly Supervised Object Localization","twitter":{"likes":4,"replies":0,"retweets":1,"ids":["1370648012452556803"]},"id":"01bc0961-fdce-5e5e-8270-c59cea0b01a6","s2id":"c0b29e11d0770f96b409555cba99e785a3316f96","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Pan_Unveiling_the_Potential_of_Structure_Preserving_for_Weakly_Supervised_Object_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Xingjia Pan","Yingguo Gao","Zhiwen Lin","Fan Tang","Weiming Dong","Haolei Yuan","Feiyue Huang","Changsheng Xu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04523"}},{"node":{"abstract":"MoCo is effective for unsupervised image representation learning. In this paper, we propose VideoMoCo for unsupervised video representation learning. Given a video sequence as an input sample, we improve the temporal feature representations of MoCo from two perspectives. First, we introduce a generator to drop out several frames from this sample temporally. The discriminator is then learned to encode similar feature representations regardless of frame removals. By adaptively dropping out different frames during training iterations of adversarial learning, we augment this input sample to train a temporally robust encoder. Second, we use temporal decay to model key attenuation in the memory queue when computing the contrastive loss. As the momentum encoder updates after keys enqueue, the representation ability of these keys degrades when we use the current input sample for contrastive learning. This degradation is reflected via temporal decay to attend the input sample to recent keys in the queue. As a result, we adapt MoCo to learn video representations without empirically designing pretext tasks. By empowering the temporal robustness of the encoder and modeling the temporal decay of the keys, our VideoMoCo improves MoCo temporally based on contrastive learning.

Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks.

The resulting streams of events are of high value by themselves, especially for high speed motion estimation. However, a growing body of work has also focused on the reconstruction of intensity frames from the events, as this allows bridging the gap with the existing literature on appearance- and frame-based computer vision. Recent work has mostly approached this problem using neural networks trained with synthetic, ground-truth data. In this work we approach, for the first time, the intensity reconstruction problem from a self-supervised learning perspective. Our method, which leverages the knowledge of the inner workings of event cameras, combines estimated optical flow and the event-based photometric constancy to train neural networks without the need for any ground-truth or synthetic data. Results across multiple datasets show that the performance of the proposed self-supervised approach is in line with the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we propose a novel, lightweight neural network for optical flow estimation that achieves high speed inference with only a minor drop in performance.","citations":2,"title":"Back to Event Basics: Self-Supervised Learning of Image Reconstruction for Event Cameras via Photometric Constancy","twitter":{"likes":8,"replies":1,"retweets":5,"ids":["1307268437845082115","1307087153436995584","1307924626849198080","1307660860488396801","1307464804500738050","1306951251377238016","1306787537558568961","1306781879874576384","1306770003509817345"]},"id":"bb7a4f94-7b07-5544-a91d-5c4e0c27b25c","s2id":"2f287d9a3658152385e1714b7aa784f3ca1b1296","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Paredes-Valles_Back_to_Event_Basics_Self-Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Reconstruction_for_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Federico Paredes-Valles","Guido C.

Video representations are formed from ordered tuples of varying numbers of frames, which allows sub-sequences of actions at different speeds and temporal offsets to be compared. Our proposed Temporal-Relational CrossTransformers (TRX) achieve state-of-the-art results on few-shot splits of Kinetics, Something-Something V2 (SSv2), HMDB51 and UCF101.

Recently, multiple-solution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture disentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQ-VAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images.

Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. Experiments on a newly collected multi-view dataset show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of the novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.

We thus hereby introduce the first joint detection and description of line segments in a single deep network.

Existing attack methods aim to deceive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers by manipulating RGB images that are fed directly to the classifiers. However, these approaches typically neglect the influence of the camera optics and image processing pipeline (ISP) that produce the network inputs. ISPs transform RAW measurements to RGB images and traditionally are assumed to preserve adversarial patterns. In fact, these low-level pipelines can destroy, introduce or amplify adversarial patterns that can deceive a downstream detector. As a result, optimized patterns can become adversarial for the classifier after being transformed by a certain camera ISP or optical lens system but not for others. In this work, we examine and develop such an attack that deceives a specific camera ISP while leaving others intact, using the same downstream classifier. We frame this camera-specific attack as a multi-task optimization problem, relying on a differentiable approximation for the ISP itself. We validate the proposed method using recent state-of-the-art automotive hardware ISPs, achieving 92% fooling rate when attacking a specific ISP.

Recently, both optimization-based and learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the realistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, etc., of the real world, thus can-not produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise to the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted version to the general fitting pipeline, to tackle the above problem. Specifically, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map and a latent code representing other fac-tors as inputs and renders a realistic face image. Since the GAR learns to model the complicated real-world image, instead of relying on the simplified graphics rules, it is capable of producing realistic images, which essentially inhibits the domain-shift noise in training and optimization. Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel approach to predict 3D face parameters, in which we first obtain fine initial parameters via Renderer Invertingand then refine it with gradient-based optimizers.

Learning to perform spatially distributed tasks is motivated by the frequent availability of only sparse labels across tasks, and the desire for a compact multi-tasking network. To facilitate CompositeTasking, we introduce a novel task conditioning model -- a single encoder-decoder network that performs multiple, spatially varying tasks at once. The proposed network takes an image and a set of pixel-wise dense task requests as inputs, and performs the requested prediction task for each pixel. Moreover, we also learn the composition of tasks that needs to be performed according to some CompositeTasking rules, which includes the decision of where to apply which task. It not only offers us a compact network for multi-tasking, but also allows for task-editing. Another strength of the proposed method is demonstrated by only having to supply sparse supervision per task. The obtained results are on par with our baselines that use dense supervision and a multi-headed multi-tasking design.

The main difference between image classifiers and video classifiers is that the latter usually use temporal information contained within the video. In this work we present a manipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering temporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers and is implementable in the real world. After demonstrating the manipulation of action classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make universal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition, we generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant perturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the perturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models and the transferability of the attack was demonstrated.

Most existing deep learning algorithms for 3D shape analysis are not robust to rotations and are often trained on synthetic datasets consisting of pre-aligned shapes, yielding poor generalization to unseen poses. This observation motivates a growing interest in rotation invariant and equivariant methods. The field of rotation equivariant deep learning is developing in recent years thanks to a well established theory of Lie group representations and convolutions. A fundamental problem in equivariant deep learning is to design activation functions which are both informative and preserve equivariance. The recently introduced Tensor Field Network (TFN) framework provides a rotation equivariant network design for point cloud analysis. TFN features undergo a rotation in feature space given a rotation of the input pointcloud. TFN and similar designs consider nonlinearities which operate only over rotation invariant features such as the norm of equivariant features to preserve equivariance, making them unable to capture the directional information. In a recent work entitled \"Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Convolutions on Geometric Graphs\" Hann et al. interpret 2D rotation equivariant features as Fourier coefficients of functions on the circle. In this work we transpose the idea of Hann et al. to 3D by interpreting TFN features as spherical harmonics coefficients of functions on the sphere. We introduce a new equivariant nonlinearity and pooling for TFN. We show improvments over the original TFN design and other equivariant nonlinearities in classification and segmentation tasks. Furthermore our method is competitive with state of the art rotation invariant methods in some instances.","citations":null,"title":"A Functional Approach to Rotation Equivariant Non-Linearities for Tensor Field Networks.","twitter":null,"id":"6766982a-d433-5b0b-a761-1694480ffcc3","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Poulenard_A_Functional_Approach_to_Rotation_Equivariant_Non-Linearities_for_Tensor_Field_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Adrien Poulenard","Leonidas J.

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown tremendous success in HDR deghosting. However, CNN-based HDR deghosting methods require collecting large datasets with ground truth, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. This paper proposes a pioneering work by introducing zero and few-shot learning strategies for data-efficient HDR deghosting. Our approach consists of two stages of training. In stage one, we train the model with few labeled (5 or less) dynamic samples and a pool of unlabeled samples with a self-supervised loss. We use the trained model to predict HDRs for the unlabeled samples. To derive data for the next stage of training, we propose a novel method for generating corresponding dynamic inputs from the predicted HDRs of unlabeled data. The generated artificial dynamic inputs and predicted HDRs are used as paired labeled data. In stage two, we finetune the model with the original few labeled data and artificially generated labeled data. Our few-shot approach outperforms many fully-supervised methods in two publicly available datasets, using as little as five labeled dynamic samples.","citations":null,"title":"Labeled From Unlabeled: Exploiting Unlabeled Data for Few-Shot Deep HDR Deghosting","twitter":null,"id":"c6a01abb-1dfd-58f5-8155-ba9bb56a0395","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Prabhakar_Labeled_From_Unlabeled_Exploiting_Unlabeled_Data_for_Few-Shot_Deep_HDR_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["K.

Geometry-based sensor fusion has shown great promise for perception tasks such as object detection and motion forecasting. However, for the actual driving task, the global context of the 3D scene is key, e.g. a change in traffic light state can affect the behavior of a vehicle geometrically distant from that traffic light. Geometry alone may therefore be insufficient for effectively fusing representations in end-to-end driving models. In this work, we demonstrate that imitation learning policies based on existing sensor fusion methods under-perform in the presence of a high density of dynamic agents and complex scenarios, which require global contextual reasoning, such as handling traffic oncoming from multiple directions at uncontrolled intersections. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a novel Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer, to integrate image and LiDAR representations using attention.

However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement.

Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is designed to combine these two regression granularities in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves the precise boundaries and reliable confidence of proposals through progressive refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets: HACS, ActivityNet-v1.3, and THUMOS-14, where TCANet can generate proposals with high precision and recall. By combining with the existing action classifier, TCANet can obtain remarkable temporal action detection performance compared with other methods. Not surprisingly, the proposed TCANet won the 1st place in the CVPR 2020 - HACS challenge leaderboard on temporal action localization task.","citations":4,"title":"Temporal Context Aggregation Network for Temporal Action Proposal Refinement","twitter":null,"id":"d0c5ee8b-4853-507b-a422-40972f74081e","s2id":"8cf51059c87a9b5abf04cf959bbf75ab6ffff8c3","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qing_Temporal_Context_Aggregation_Network_for_Temporal_Action_Proposal_Refinement_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Zhiwu Qing","Haisheng Su","Weihao Gan","Dongliang Wang","Wei Wu","Xiang Wang","Yu Qiao","Junjie Yan","Changxin Gao","Nong Sang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13141"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We study a worst-case scenario in generalization: Out-of-domain generalization from a single source. The goal is to learn a robust model from a single source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions. This challenging problem has been seldom investigated while existing solutions suffer from various limitations. In this paper, we propose a new solution. The key idea is to augment the source capacity in both input and label spaces, while the augmentation is guided by uncertainty assessment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to (1) access the generalization uncertainty from a single source and (2) leverage it to guide both input and label augmentation for robust generalization. The model training and deployment are effectively organized in a Bayesian meta-learning framework. We conduct extensive comparisons and ablation study to validate our approach. The results prove our superior performance in a wide scope of tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, text classification, and speech recognition.","citations":3,"title":"Uncertainty-Guided Model Generalization to Unseen Domains","twitter":{"likes":11,"replies":0,"retweets":1,"ids":["1385773369665015809"]},"id":"8d82dc7d-9596-54fc-af1f-e1bac103d2c0","s2id":"2c0ccf919d5347b87677e7a16a3ba5e555f51710","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qiao_Uncertainty-Guided_Model_Generalization_to_Unseen_Domains_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Fengchun Qiao","Xi Peng"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07531"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Caricature is an artistic representation that deliberately exaggerates the distinctive features of a human face to convey humor or sarcasm. However, reconstructing a 3D caricature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to fill this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the first large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality diversified 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations including a paired 2D caricature image, camera parameters, and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the advantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline approach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face deformations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detail-rich implicit functions and the parametric mesh representations. In particular, we first register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to resolve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for accurate alignment. Our method is able to generate high-fidelity 3D caricature in a pre-defined mesh topology that is animation-ready. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 3DCaricShop to verify the significance of the database and the effectiveness of the proposed method. We will release 3DCaricShop upon publication.","citations":0,"title":"3DCaricShop: A Dataset and a Baseline Method for Single-View 3D Caricature Face Reconstruction","twitter":{"likes":38,"replies":2,"retweets":4,"ids":["1371682654156951557","1373128086703595523","1371718732314075136"]},"id":"80691b93-3ec0-5a4f-bef5-064a7ba1361f","s2id":"1cccbd656dd00ab988e82138df5c18a9954954d4","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qiu_3DCaricShop_A_Dataset_and_a_Baseline_Method_for_Single-View_3D_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Yuda Qiu","Xiaojie Xu","Lingteng Qiu","Yan Pan","Yushuang Wu","Weikai Chen","Xiaoguang Han"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08204"}},{"node":{"abstract":"In this paper, we present ViP-DeepLab, a unified model attempting to tackle the long-standing and challenging inverse projection problem in vision, which we model as restoring the point clouds from perspective image sequences while providing each point with instance-level semantic interpretations.

The existing datasets mostly label only one of the facets for model training, resulting in the video representation that biases to only one facet depending on the training dataset. There is no study yet on how to learn a video representation from multifaceted labels, and whether multifaceted information is helpful for video representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, MUlti-Faceted Integration (MUFI), to aggregate facets from different datasets for learning a representation that could reflect the full spectrum of video content. Technically, MUFI formulates the problem as visual-semantic embedding learning, which explicitly maps video representation into a rich semantic embedding space, and jointly optimizes video representation from two perspectives. One is to capitalize on the intra-facet supervision between each video and its own label descriptions, and the second predicts the \"semantic representation\" of each video from the facets of other datasets as the inter-facet supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that learning 3D CNN via our MUFI framework on a union of four large-scale video datasets plus two image datasets leads to superior capability of video representation. The pre-learnt 3D CNN with MUFI also shows clear improvements over other approaches on several downstream video applications. More remarkably, MUFI achieves 98.1%/80.9% on UCF101/HMDB51 for action recognition and 101.5% in terms of CIDEr-D score on MSVD for video captioning.","citations":null,"title":"Boosting Video Representation Learning With Multi-Faceted Integration","twitter":null,"id":"e6676b44-3c08-5cfe-8113-61a9afc2ef58","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qiu_Boosting_Video_Representation_Learning_With_Multi-Faceted_Integration_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Zhaofan Qiu","Ting Yao","Chong-Wah Ngo","Xiao-Ping Zhang","Dong Wu","Tao Mei"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a new type of compressive imaging system that compresses multiple frames of images into a single snapshot measurement, which enjoys low cost, low bandwidth, and high-speed sensing rate. By applying the existing SCI methods to deal with hyperspectral images, however, could not fully exploit the underlying structures, and thereby demonstrate unsatisfactory reconstruction performance. To remedy such issue, this paper aims to propose a new effective method by taking advantage of two intrinsic priors of the hyperspectral images, namely deep image denoising and total variation (TV) priors. Specifically, we propose an optimization objective to utilize these two priors. By solving this optimization objective, our method is equivalent to incorporate a weighted FFDNet and a 2DTV or 3DTV denoiser into the plug-and-play framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the resulting plug-and-play algorithm under relatively weak conditions such as without using diminishing step sizes.

Our representations are learned using a contrastive loss, where two augmented clips from the same short video are pulled together in the embedding space, while clips from different videos are pushed away. We study what makes for good data augmentations for video self-supervised learning and find that both spatial and temporal information are crucial. We carefully design data augmentations involving spatial and temporal cues. Concretely, we propose a temporally consistent spatial augmentation method to impose strong spatial augmentations on each frame of the video while maintaining the temporal consistency across frames. We also propose a sampling-based temporal augmentation method to avoid overly enforcing invariance on clips that are distant in time. On Kinetics-600, a linear classifier trained on the representations learned by CVRL achieves 70.4% top-1 accuracy with a 3D-ResNet-50 (R3D-50) backbone, outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training by 15.7% and SimCLR unsupervised pre-training by 18.8% using the same inflated R3D-50.

To this end, we devise a novel approach that learns to partition the scene objects into two groups, essential ones and minor ones, under the supervision that if only the essential ones are kept while the minor ones are erased in the input image, a scene recognizer would preserve its original prediction. Specifically, we introduce a learnable graph neural network (GNN) for labelling scene objects, based on which the minor ones are wiped off by an off-the-shelf image inpainter. The features of the inpainted image derived in this way, together with those learned from the GNN with the minor-object nodes pruned, are expected to fool the scene discriminator.

It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules. This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper, we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data, instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines. A human study however indicates that ours uses astronomically more data to learn when compared to an average human, necessitating future research (with or without our dataset).","citations":0,"title":"PQA: Perceptual Question Answering","twitter":null,"id":"31a3f31b-635e-5fc2-9992-c5c04be93a61","s2id":"67e7d10585ddb00795120f19a8db14893791db59","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qi_PQA_Perceptual_Question_Answering_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Yonggang Qi","Kai Zhang","Aneeshan Sain","Yi-Zhe Song"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03589"}},{"node":{"abstract":"In instance-level detection tasks (e.g., object detection), reducing input resolution is an easy option to improve runtime efficiency.

We first identify the challenge of applying knowledge distillation to teacher and student networks that act on different input resolutions. To tackle the challenge, we explore the idea of spatially aligning feature maps between models of different input resolutions, by shifting the position of the feature pyramid structure. With the alignment idea, we introduce aligned multi-scale training to train a multi-scale teacher that can distill its knowledge seamlessly to a low-resolution student. Furthermore, we propose cross feature-level fusion to dynamically fuse the multi-resolution features of the same teacher, to better guide the student. On several instance-level detection tasks and datasets, the low-resolution models trained via our approach perform competitively with high-resolution models trained via conventional multi-scale training, while outperforming the latter's low-resolution models by 2.1% to 3.6% in mAP.","citations":null,"title":"Multi-Scale Aligned Distillation for Low-Resolution Detection","twitter":null,"id":"ccbb5a44-c408-55cf-9f5b-e5686441c3bd","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Qi_Multi-Scale_Aligned_Distillation_for_Low-Resolution_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Lu Qi","Jason Kuen","Jiuxiang Gu","Zhe Lin","Yi Wang","Yukang Chen","Yanwei Li","Jiaya Jia"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Existing rain-removal algorithms often tackle either rain streak removal or raindrop removal, and thus may fail to handle real-world rainy scenes. Besides, the lack of real-world deraining datasets comprising different types of rain and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth also impedes deraining algorithm development. In this paper, we aim to address real-world deraining problems from two aspects. First, we propose a complementary cascaded network architecture, namely CCN, to remove rain streaks and raindrops in a unified framework. Specifically, our CCN removes raindrops and rain streaks in a complementary fashion, i.e., raindrop removal followed by rain streak removal and vice versa, and then fuses the results via an attention based fusion module. Considering significant shape and structure differences between rain streaks and raindrops, it is difficult to manually design a sophisticated network to remove them effectively. Thus, we employ neural architecture search to adaptively find optimal architectures within our specified deraining search space. Second, we present a new real-world rain dataset, namely RainDS, to prosper the development of deraining algorithms in practical scenarios. RainDS consists of rain images in different types and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth, including rain streak only, raindrop only, and both of them. Extensive experimental results on both existing benchmarks and RainDS demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.","citations":null,"title":"Removing Raindrops and Rain Streaks in One Go","twitter":null,"id":"dcc1b707-5052-5dd2-84ef-76ed64a47252","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Quan_Removing_Raindrops_and_Rain_Streaks_in_One_Go_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Ruijie Quan","Xin Yu","Yuanzhi Liang","Yi Yang"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Given the prominence of current 3D sensors, a fine-grained analysis on the basic point cloud data is worthy of further investigation. Particularly, real point cloud scenes can intuitively capture complex surroundings in the real world, but due to 3D data's raw nature, it is very challenging for machine perception. In this work, we concentrate on the essential visual task, semantic segmentation, for large-scale point cloud data collected in reality. On the one hand, to reduce the ambiguity in nearby points, we augment their local context by fully utilizing both geometric and semantic features in a bilateral structure. On the other hand, we comprehensively interpret the distinctness of the points from multiple resolutions and represent the feature map following an adaptive fusion method at point-level for accurate semantic segmentation. Further, we provide specific ablation studies and intuitive visualizations to validate our key modules.

Despite a large number of existing works, solving the data association problem in any MC-MOT pipeline is arguably one of the most challenging tasks. Developing a robust MC-MOT system, however, is still highly challenging due to many practical issues such as inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, or the trajectory occlusions of the objects between the cameras. To address these problems, this work, therefore, proposes a new Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) approach to solve the data association task. Compared to existing methods, our new model offers several advantages, including better feature representations and the ability to recover from lost tracks during camera transitions. Moreover, our model works gracefully regardless of the overlapping ratios between the cameras. Experimental results show that we outperform existing MC-MOT algorithms by a large margin on several practical datasets. Notably, our model works favorably on online settings but can be extended to an incremental approach for large-scale datasets.","citations":null,"title":"DyGLIP: A Dynamic Graph Model With Link Prediction for Accurate Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking","twitter":null,"id":"06ee7515-b620-5e09-aad2-fa7f6f142167","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Quach_DyGLIP_A_Dynamic_Graph_Model_With_Link_Prediction_for_Accurate_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Kha Gia Quach","Pha Nguyen","Huu Le","Thanh-Dat Truong","Chi Nhan Duong","Minh-Triet Tran","Khoa Luu"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"While current 3D object recognition research mostly focuses on the real-time, onboard scenario, there are many offboard use cases of perception that are largely under-explored, such as using machines to automatically generate high-quality 3D labels.

In this paper, we propose a novel offboard 3D object detection pipeline using point cloud sequence data. Observing that different frames capture complementary views of objects, we design the offboard detector to make use of the temporal points through both multi-frame object detection and novel object-centric refinement models. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset, our pipeline named 3D Auto Labeling shows significant gains compared to the state-of-the-art onboard detectors and our offboard baselines.

Complex lane line shapes require high-dimensional output of CNNs to model global structures, which further increases the demand for model capacity and training data. In contrast, the locality of a lane marker has finite geometric variations and spatial coverage. We propose a novel lane marker detection solution, FOLOLane, that focuses on modeling local patterns and achieving prediction of global structures in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the CNN models low-complexity local patterns with two separate heads, the first one predicts the existence of key points, and the second refines the location of key points in the local range and correlates key points of the same lane line. The locality of the task is consistent with the limited FOV of the feature in CNN, which in turn leads to more stable training and better generalization.

Existing methods for learning with noisy labels are limited by two aspects. Firstly, methods based on the noise probability modeling can only be applied to class-level noisy labels. Secondly, others based on the memorization effect outperform in synthetic noise but get weak promotion in real-world noisy datasets. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel label-noise robust method named Discrepant Adversarial Training (DAT). The DAT method has ability of enforcing prominent feature extraction by matching feature distribution between clean and noisy data. Therefore, under the noise-free feature representation, the deep network can simply output the correct result. To better capture the divergence between the noisy and clean distribution, a new metric is designed to change the distribution divergence into computable. By minimizing the proposed metric with a min-max training of discrepancy on classifiers and generators, DAT can match noisy data to clean data in the feature space. To the best of our knowledge, DAT is the first to address the noisy label problem from the perspective of the feature distribution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that DAT can consistently outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric re-rendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision.

In this paper, we offer a change in perspective and demonstrate the existence of universal attacks for geometric data (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in the spectral domain, where the attacks take the form of small perturbations to short eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geometry is then synthesized via shape-from-spectrum recovery.

The current alternative is to use specialized models that require explicit supervision on the vector graphics representation at training time. This is not ideal because large-scale high-quality vector-graphics datasets are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the vector representation for a given design is not unique, so models that supervise on the vector representation are unnecessarily constrained.

After a person detection step, a 4D CNN produces short-term person-specific representations which are then linked across time by a differentiable matcher. The linked descriptions are then merged and deconvolved into 3D poses. This joint spatio-temporal formulation contrasts with previous piece-wise strategies that treat 2D pose estimation, 2D-to-3D lifting, and 3D pose tracking as independent sub-problems that are error-prone when solved in isolation. Furthermore, unlike previous methods, TesseTrack is robust to changes in the number of camera views and achieves very good results even if a single view is available at inference time. Quantitative evaluation of 3D pose reconstruction accuracy on standard benchmarks shows significant improvements over the state of the art. Evaluation of multi-person articulated 3D pose tracking in our novel evaluation framework demonstrates the superiority of TesseTrack over strong baselines.","citations":null,"title":"TesseTrack: End-to-End Learnable Multi-Person Articulated 3D Pose Tracking","twitter":{"likes":18,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1366214110036193280"]},"id":"d01b9223-83c0-5994-ac95-3c250b12d198","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Reddy_TesseTrack_End-to-End_Learnable_Multi-Person_Articulated_3D_Pose_Tracking_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["N Dinesh Reddy","Laurent Guigues","Leonid Pishchulin","Jayan Eledath","Srinivasa G.

Surprisingly, a very promising direction, using pre-trained deep features, has been mostly overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected, but unreported result, that combining pre-trained features with simple anomaly detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex, state-of-the-art methods. In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt pre-trained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic regularization inspired by continual learning.

Existing efforts leverage a long training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion transfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each model can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training videos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer techniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently drawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either 2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so, sacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an end-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck Network, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we propose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image content, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields. We address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across different body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content from the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects performing complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation. This allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving people.

Due to the lack of prior knowledge about the primary objects, identifying them from videos is the major challenge of UVOS. Previous methods often regard the moving objects as primary ones and rely on optical flow to capture the motion cues in videos, but the flow information alone is insufficient to distinguish the primary objects from the background objects that move together. This is because, when the noisy motion features are combined with the appearance features, the localization of the primary objects is misguided. To address this problem, we propose a novel reciprocal transformation network to discover primary objects by correlating three key factors: the intra-frame contrast, the motion cues, and temporal coherence of recurring objects. Each corresponds to a representative type of primary object, and our reciprocal mechanism enables an organic coordination of them to effectively remove ambiguous distractions from videos. Additionally, to exclude the information of the moving background objects from motion features, our transformation module enables to reciprocally transform the appearance features to enhance the motion features, so as to focus on the moving objects with salient appearance while removing the co-moving outliers.

Due to the fact that such a vision task usually performs worse than its counterpart speech recognition, one potential scheme is to distill knowledge from a teacher pretrained by audio signals. However, the latent domain gap between the cross-modal data could lead to an learning ambiguity and thus limits the performance of lip reading. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative framework for lip reading, and two aspects of issues are considered: 1) the teacher should understand bi-modal knowledge to possibly bridge the inherent cross-modal gap; 2) the teacher should adjust teaching contents adaptively with the evolution of the student. To these ends, we introduce a trainable \"master\" network which ingests both audio signals and silent lip videos instead of a pretrained teacher. The master produces logits from three modalities of features: audio modality, video modality, and their combination. To further provide an interactive strategy to fuse these knowledge organically, we regularize the master with the task-specific feedback from the student, in which the requirement of the student is implicitly embedded. Meanwhile we involve a couple of \"tutor\" networks into our system as guidance for emphasizing the fruitful knowledge flexibly.

Given a set of source images depicting a scene from freely distributed viewpoints, SVS synthesizes new views of the scene. The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection.

Equivariance or invariance has been employed standalone in the previous works; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used jointly. Simultaneous optimization for both of these contrasting objectives allows the model to jointly learn features that are not only independent of the input transformation but also the features that encode the structure of geometric transformations. These complementary sets of features help generalize well to novel classes with only a few data samples. We achieve additional improvements by incorporating a novel self-supervised distillation objective.

The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics, including evaluation of unsupervised algorithms. We demonstrate two methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a psychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous efforts based on human judgments. We were able to scale to the full 50,000 image ILSVRC validation set through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that were most uncertain. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human semantic judgments. In addition to the human similarity judgments, pre-trained psychological embeddings and code for inferring variational embeddings are made publicly available.

Instead, HDR cameras acquire multiple measurements with different exposures, gains and photodiodes, from which an Image Signal Processor (ISP) reconstructs an HDR image. HDR image recovery for dynamic scenes is an open challenge because of motion and because stitched captures have different noise characteristics, resulting in artefacts that the ISP has to resolve---in real time and at triple-digit megapixel resolutions. Traditionally, hardware ISP settings used by downstream vision modules have been chosen by domain experts.

Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision, and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member) ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class. Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only constitute a very small portion of training samples. We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models' responses are mostly similar among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.

Especially, recent contrastive learning methods have shown impressive performances on downstream image classification tasks. While these contrastive methods mainly focus on generating invariant global representations at the image-level under semantic-preserving transformations, they are prone to overlook spatial consistency of local representations and therefore have a limitation in pretraining for localization tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Moreover, aggressively cropped views used in existing contrastive methods can minimize representation distances between the semantically different regions of a single image. In this paper, we propose a spatially consistent representation learning algorithm (SCRL) for multi-object and location-specific tasks. In particular, we devise a novel self-supervised objective that tries to produce coherent spatial representations of a randomly cropped local region according to geometric translations and zooming operations. On various downstream localization tasks with benchmark datasets, the proposed SCRL shows significant performance improvements over the image-level supervised pretraining as well as the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods.","citations":3,"title":"Spatially Consistent Representation Learning","twitter":{"likes":37,"replies":2,"retweets":6,"ids":["1369832586432897025","1369840766638559235","1387763813513105418","1387582569772982276","1383314078186151939","1370037129502412800","1369906460595916801","1369837548927913984"]},"id":"a9688c67-bac0-50eb-b1eb-3e2293360fa5","s2id":"47d62aff50c6cc27c2718d918c5b666ce6fcff08","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Roh_Spatially_Consistent_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Byungseok Roh","Wuhyun Shin","Ildoo Kim","Sungwoong Kim"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06122"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Objects moving at high speed appear significantly blurred when captured with cameras.

These approaches commonly learn the relationship between global contexts and attention activations by using fully-connected layers or linear transformations. However, we empirically find that though many parameters are introduced, these attention blocks may not learn the relationship well. In this paper, we hypothesize that the relationship is predetermined. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet extremely efficient channel attention block, called Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT), which achieves contextual feature excitation using a Gaussian function that satisfies the presupposed relationship. According to whether the standard deviation of the Gaussian function is learnable, we develop two versions of GCT: GCT-B0 and GCT-B1. GCT-B0 is a parameter-free channel attention block by fixing the standard deviation. It directly maps global contexts to attention activations without learning. In contrast, GCT-B1 is a parameterized channel attention block, which adaptively learns the standard deviation to enhance the mapping ability. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our GCTs lead to consistent improvements across various deep CNNs and detectors.

In particular, FDN first decomposes the basic features extracted from a backbone network into a set of facial action-aware latent features to model expression similarities. Then, FRN captures the intra-feature and inter-feature relationships for latent features to characterize expression-specific variations, and reconstructs the expression feature. To this end, two modules including an intra-feature relation modeling module and an inter-feature relation modeling module are developed in FRN.

We present a new neural representation for face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance responsible for the final appearance from a monocular image. Instead of modeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models, our neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a geometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light direction, viewpoint and face geometry.

Against this issue, this paper proposes a new scheme aiming to capture general weighting principle in a data-driven manner. Specifically, such weighting principle is delivered by an explicit function, called hyperweight-net (HWnet), mapping from an input noisy image to its properly imposed weights. A Bayesian framework, as well as a variational inference algorithm, for inferring HWnet parameters is elaborately designed, expecting to extract the latent weighting rule for general diverse and complicated noisy HSIs. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the learned HWnet can be not only finely generalized to different noise types from those used in training, but also effectively transferred to other weighted models for the issue. Besides, as a sounder guidance, HWnet can help to more faithfully and robustly achieve deep hyperspectral prior(DHP).

However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic. Extensive experiments show that our style-agnostic model yields state-of-the-art performance for both category-level and instance-level SBIR.","citations":3,"title":"StyleMeUp: Towards Style-Agnostic Sketch-Based Image Retrieval","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1378203934175731712"]},"id":"65c67f3c-79da-5338-8219-623dd7058cb6","s2id":"52bffd428b3f0c14509d6e68699ece7c46f7cf0b","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Sain_StyleMeUp_Towards_Style-Agnostic_Sketch-Based_Image_Retrieval_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Aneeshan Sain","Ayan Kumar Bhunia","Yongxin Yang","Tao Xiang","Yi-Zhe Song"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15706"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present SCANimate, an end-to-end trainable framework that takes raw 3D scans of a clothed human and turns them into an animatable avatar. These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle-consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without template-based surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on various clothing types with different amounts of training data, outperforming existing solutions and other variants in terms of fidelity and generality in every setting.

The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the \"distillation\" of features at various layers of an expert network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given an input sample. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploitation of the expert's knowledge and a more distinctive discrepancy between the two networks, compared to utilizing only the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework to localize anomalous regions. Despite the striking difference between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or significantly superior results compared to SOTA on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, MVTecAD, Retinal-OCT, and two other medical datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.","citations":3,"title":"Multiresolution Knowledge Distillation for Anomaly Detection","twitter":{"likes":41,"replies":1,"retweets":2,"ids":["1366316140310355968","1332051400788885504","1332839027662209024","1400700655078023171","1333393574281453569","1331382196704186372","1331246506024841220","1331065141069291520"]},"id":"1f3f8013-87ac-57f7-8c09-af21c7992a25","s2id":"6885c45614f78f9d2e7cc8ef11b3c38b34e67f7d","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Salehi_Multiresolution_Knowledge_Distillation_for_Anomaly_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Mohammadreza Salehi","Niousha Sadjadi","Soroosh Baselizadeh","Mohammad H.

Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We explore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes for the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first deblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only partly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address multi-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and conditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label generation aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly improves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification, we see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of motion blur.

In the medical context, the latter may be an important biomarker for neurological impairments in infants. Whilst many methods exist, their application has been limited by the need for well annotated large datasets and the inability to generalize to humans of different shapes and body compositions, e.g. children and infants. In this paper we present a novel method for learning pose estimators for human adults and infants in an unsupervised fashion. We approach this as a learnable template matching problem facilitated by deep feature extractors. Human-interpretable landmarks are estimated by transforming a template consisting of predefined body parts that are characterized by 2D Gaussian distributions. Enforcing a connectivity prior guides our model to meaningful human shape representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets including adults and infants.","citations":0,"title":"Unsupervised Human Pose Estimation Through Transforming Shape Templates","twitter":{"likes":36,"replies":2,"retweets":7,"ids":["1392093326522961922"]},"id":"2a0a863d-398d-5bb1-966f-c5911c24da46","s2id":"e0df00ae5d921da18e12523cd753614e08156e94","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Schmidtke_Unsupervised_Human_Pose_Estimation_Through_Transforming_Shape_Templates_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Luca Schmidtke","Athanasios Vlontzos","Simon Ellershaw","Anna Lukens","Tomoki Arichi","Bernhard Kainz"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04154"}},{"node":{"abstract":"While most conversational AI systems focus on textual dialogue only, conditioning utterances on visual context (when it's available) can lead to more realistic conversations.

Analyzing contrastive SSL methods shows that they have poor visual grounding and receive poor supervisory signal when trained on scene images. We propose Contrast Attention-Supervised Tuning (CAST) to overcome these limitations. CAST uses unsupervised saliency maps to intelligently sample crops, and to provide grounding supervision via a Grad-CAM attention loss. Experiments on COCO show that CAST significantly improves the features learned by SSL methods on scene images, and further experiments show that CAST-trained models are more robust to changes in backgrounds.

Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of a low-resolution modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial task, since each multi-modal pair varies greatly in its internal correlations. For this reason, traditional state-of-the-arts which are trained on external datasets often struggle with yielding an artifact-free result that is still loyal to the target modality characteristics. We present CMSR, a single-pair approach for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution. The network is internally trained on the two input images only, in a self-supervised manner, learns their internal statistics and correlations, and applies them to upsample the target modality. CMSR contains an internal transformer which is trained on-the-fly together with the up-sampling process itself and without supervision, to allow dealing with pairs that are only weakly aligned. We show that CMSR produces state-of-the-art super resolved images, yet without introducing artifacts or irrelevant details that originate from the RGB image only.","citations":0,"title":"Single Pair Cross-Modality Super Resolution","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1284890991233773569","1284724855846264833","1284694825804193793","1284513399792074753","1284317278209806336","1284121121105879042","1283939763070947328","1253051520867762176","1252955536573767680","1252834624113225731","1252819559825825796","1252789158109564928","1252759193435672577"]},"id":"58b4b736-43cc-5ea3-8b07-4c565993276c","s2id":"645bb80a11cf1cbbba014227033b492f0f0e027b","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Shacht_Single_Pair_Cross-Modality_Super_Resolution_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Guy Shacht","Dov Danon","Sharon Fogel","Daniel Cohen-Or"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09965"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Adversarial examples have pointed out Deep Neural Network's vulnerability to small local noise.

In recent literature, it is shown that pre-trained GANs, on a different dataset, can be transferred to improve the image generation from a small target data.

In particular, the new classes may borrow knowledge from the related old classes, or share knowledge among themselves to improve the training. This motivates us to study the problem of efficient conditional GAN transfer with knowledge propagation across classes. To address this problem, we introduce a new GAN transfer method to explicitly propagate the knowledge from the old classes to the new classes. The key idea is to enforce the popularly used conditional batch normalization (BN) to learn the class-specific information of the new classes from that of the old classes, with implicit knowledge sharing among the new ones. This allows for an efficient knowledge propagation from the old classes to the new ones, with the BN parameters increasing linearly with the number of new classes. The extensive evaluation demonstrates the clear superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art competitors for efficient conditional GAN transfer tasks.

The main difficulties lie in the large domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution across a variety of datasets, which greatly limit the real-world applicability of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper, we propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the robustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost volume representation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing multiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive field, we can extract robust structural representations for initial disparity estimation.

Specifically, we employ a variance-based uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of unlikely correspondences. By iteratively narrowing down the disparity search space and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is gradually refined in a coarse-to-fine manner.

With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.","citations":39,"title":"Closed-Form Factorization of Latent Semantics in GANs","twitter":{"likes":398,"replies":4,"retweets":143,"ids":["1283221912949264386","1284604772444590080","1283374017232007170","1283418204136550400","1283221636691496960","1374271949799448578","1374272207887683587","1283218694676439041","1283296055753408512","1283411255076806656","1283569693039755264","1283567183470096385","1283607541734346753","1283803785144553472","1283864133520068608","1284790580179066880","1285152905398497280","1285515383881990144","1283214910789496832"]},"id":"99cf3944-6e58-5ff2-99ba-ddf8603d94df","s2id":"dc0092d06ab76465431edfd51b08d823b7d1ff3f","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Shen_Closed-Form_Factorization_of_Latent_Semantics_in_GANs_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Yujun Shen","Bolei Zhou"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06600"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Binary grid mask representation is broadly used in instance segmentation. A representative instantiation is Mask R-CNN which predicts masks on a 28*28 binary grid. Generally, a low-resolution grid is not sufficient to capture the details, while a high-resolution grid dramatically increases the training complexity. In this paper, we propose a new mask representation by applying the discrete cosine transform(DCT) to encode the high-resolution binary grid mask into a compact vector. Our method, termed DCT-Mask, could be easily integrated into most pixel-based instance segmentation methods. Without any bells and whistles, DCT-Mask yields significant gains on different frameworks, backbones, datasets, and training schedules. It does not require any pre-processing or pre-training, and almost no harm to the running speed. Especially, for higher-quality annotations and more complex backbones, our method has a greater improvement. Moreover, we analyze the performance of our method from the perspective of the quality of mask representation. The main reason why DCT-Mask works well is that it obtains a high-quality mask representation with low complexity.","citations":1,"title":"DCT-Mask: Discrete Cosine Transform Mask Representation for Instance Segmentation","twitter":null,"id":"2d9acf8d-c47e-533e-8350-65ce02dad4a2","s2id":"99c91e28292e4cfdbd40331a2d52e7e703310fb5","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Shen_DCT-Mask_Discrete_Cosine_Transform_Mask_Representation_for_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Xing Shen","Jirui Yang","Chunbo Wei","Bing Deng","Jianqiang Huang","Xian-Sheng Hua","Xiaoliang Cheng","Kewei Liang"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Face clustering is a promising method for annotating unlabeled face images. Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly, however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are difficult to grasp the whole graph structure information and usually take a long time for inference. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Specifically, we design a structure-preserved subgraph sampling strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase the training data scale from 10^5 to 10^7. During inference, the STAR-FC performs efficient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the second step to mine the local structural information. The STAR-FC gets 91.97 pairwise F-score on partial MS1M within 310s which surpasses the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we are the first to train on very large-scale graph with 20M nodes, and achieve superior inference results on 12M testing data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering.

In this paper, we focus on this more difficult scenario: learning networks where both weights and activations are binary, meanwhile, without any human annotated labels. We observe that the commonly used contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy, since the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and representation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing self-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we present a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary networks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain desirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive learning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5 15% on BNNs. We further reveal that it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions as real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them is key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets.

However, previous works based on dense undirected interaction suffer from modeling superfluous interactions and neglect of trajectory motion tendency, and thus inevitably result in a considerable deviance from the reality. To cope with these issues, we present a Sparse Graph Convolution Network (SGCN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, the SGCN explicitly models the sparse directed interaction with a sparse directed spatial graph to capture adaptive interaction pedestrians. Meanwhile, we use a sparse directed temporal graph to model the motion tendency, thus to facilitate the prediction based on the observed direction. Finally, parameters of a bi-Gaussian distribution for trajectory prediction are estimated by fusing the above two sparse graphs. We evaluate our proposed method on the ETH and UCY datasets, and the experimental results show our method outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods by 9% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 13% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). Notably, visualizations indicate that our method can capture adaptive interactions between pedestrians and their effective motion tendencies.","citations":0,"title":"SGCN: Sparse Graph Convolution Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1380747682373902337"]},"id":"2074f9d1-8ac7-539a-bc0b-d6cfb9f9a889","s2id":"9b175ff0549462007d050680b1ae46fe9dbf4bea","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Shi_SGCN_Sparse_Graph_Convolution_Network_for_Pedestrian_Trajectory_Prediction_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Liushuai Shi","Le Wang","Chengjiang Long","Sanping Zhou","Mo Zhou","Zhenxing Niu","Gang Hua"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01528"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We introduce the concept of geometric stability to the problem of 6D object pose estimation and propose to learn pose inference based on geometrically stable patches extracted from observed 3D point clouds.

We train a deep neural network to regress 6D object pose based on geometrically stable patch groups via learning both intra-patch geometric features and inter-patch contextual features.

However, it is generally hard to prepare a high-quality dataset for all types of objects due to the ambiguity of keypoint itself. Meanwhile, current unsupervised detectors are unable to generate aligned keypoints with good coverage. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised aligned keypoint detector, Skeleton Merger, which utilizes skeletons to reconstruct objects. It is based on an Autoencoder architecture. The encoder proposes keypoints and predicts activation strengths of edges between keypoints. The decoder performs uniform sampling on the skeleton and refines it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the activation strengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged. Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD) is proposed as a distance between the input point cloud and the reconstruction composed of sub-clouds masked by activation strengths. We demonstrate that Skeleton Merger is capable of detecting semantically-rich salient keypoints with good alignment, and shows comparable performance to supervised methods on the KeypointNet dataset. It is also shown that the detector is robust to noise and subsampling.

Without training data, let alone paired data, existing autonomous vehicles often limit themselves to good conditions and stop when dense fog or snow is detected. In this work, we tackle the lack of supervised training data by combining synthetic and indirect supervision.

ZeroScatter exploits model-based, temporal, multi-view, multi-modal, and adversarial cues in a joint fashion, allowing us to train on unpaired, biased data.

To address this problem, here we propose a method termed Spatial-Semantic Patch Learning (SSPL). The training of SSPL involves two stages. First, three auxiliary tasks, consisting of a Patch Rotation Task (PRT), a Patch Segmentation Task (PST), and a Patch Classification Task (PCT), are jointly developed to learn the spatial-semantic relationship from large-scale unlabeled facial data. We thus obtain a powerful pre-trained model. In particular, PRT exploits the spatial information of facial images in a self-supervised learning manner. PST and PCT respectively capture the pixel-level and image-level semantic information of facial images based on a facial parsing model. Second, the spatial-semantic knowledge learned from auxiliary tasks is transferred to the FAR task. By doing so, it enables that only a limited number of labeled data are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model.

State-of-the-art techniques for incremental learning make use of knowledge distillation towards preventing catastrophic forgetting. Therein, one updates the network while ensuring that the network's responses to previously seen concepts remain stable throughout updates. This in practice is done by minimizing the dissimilarity between current and previous responses of the network one way or another. Our work contributes a novel method to the arsenal of distillation techniques. In contrast to previous state of the art, we propose to firstly construct low-dimensional manifolds for previous and current responses and minimize the dissimilarity between the responses along the geodesic connecting the manifolds.

As an endeavor in this direction, substantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how to paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter.

As a consequence, we find that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity possessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance pipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction between foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also introduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through a neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial transformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular semantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are then amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward.

Our approach can be used in both the zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings. Our proposed method uses weight rectifications and affine transformations in order to adapt the model to different tasks that arrive sequentially. Specifically, we adapt the network weights to work for new tasks by \"rectifying\" the weights learned from the previous task. We learn these weight rectifications using very few parameters. We additionally learn affine transformations on the outputs generated by the network in order to better adapt them for the new task.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the \"lack of textures\" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the \"non-linear and extremely large motion\" challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture. To facilitate comprehensive training and evaluations, we build a large-scale animation triplet dataset, ATD-12K, which comprises 12,000 triplets with rich annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art interpolation methods for animation videos. Notably, AnimeInterp shows favorable perceptual quality and robustness for animation scenarios in the wild.

In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

To address these problems, in this paper we propose to establish the cross-modal domain alignment via self-supervised contrastive framework, i.e., spatio-temporal contrastive domain adaptation (STCDA), to learn the joint clip-level and video-level representation alignment.

Existing approaches mainly solve the problem in two steps: event detection and then event captioning. Such two-step manner makes the quality of generated paragraphs highly dependent on the accuracy of event proposal detection which is already a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a paragraph captioning model which eschews the problematic event detection stage and directly generates paragraphs for untrimmed videos. To describe coherent and diverse events, we propose to enhance the conventional temporal attention with dynamic video memories, which progressively exposes new video features and suppresses over-accessed video contents to control visual focuses of the model. In addition, a diversity-driven training strategy is proposed to improve diversity of paragraph on the language perspective. Considering that untrimmed videos generally contain massive but redundant frames, we further augment the video encoder with keyframe awareness to improve efficiency.

However, when heavy occlusions are present, a mechanism to reidentify persons is needed. The common approach is to extract visual features from new detections and compare them with the features of previously found tracks. Since those detections can have substantial overlaps with nearby targets - especially in crowded scenarios - the extracted features are insufficient for a reliable re-identification. In contrast, we propose a novel occlusion handling strategy that explicitly models the relation between occluding and occluded tracks outperforming the feature-based approach, while not depending on a separate re-identification network. Furthermore, we improve the track management of a regression-based method in order to bypass missing detections and to deal with tracks leaving the scene at the border of the image. Finally, we apply our tracker in both temporal directions and merge tracklets belonging to the same target, which further enhances the performance.

We present Few-Shot object detection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE), a simple yet effective approach to learning contrastive-aware object proposal encodings that facilitate the classification of detected objects.

Instead, this paper explores the filter-array based color imaging mechanism of existing RGB cameras, and proposes to design the IR-cut filter properly for improved spectral recovery, which stands out as an in-between solution with better trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and implementation complexity. We further propose a deep learning based spectral reconstruction method, which allows to recover the illumination spectrum as well. Experiment results with both synthetic and real images under daylight illumination have shown the benefits of our IR-cut filter tuning method and our illumination-aware spectral reconstruction method.","citations":0,"title":"Tuning IR-Cut Filter for Illumination-Aware Spectral Reconstruction From RGB","twitter":null,"id":"c2f7b247-3498-53c2-a381-c7faf6cacf67","s2id":"1492b01afa2e75d58534d04b61281d7468cc0114","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Sun_Tuning_IR-Cut_Filter_for_Illumination-Aware_Spectral_Reconstruction_From_RGB_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Bo Sun","Junchi Yan","Xiao Zhou","Yinqiang Zheng"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14708"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Simulation has the potential to massively scale evaluation of self-driving systems, enabling rapid development as well as safe deployment. Bridging the gap between simulation and the real world requires realistic multi-agent behaviors. Existing simulation environments rely on heuristic-based models that directly encode traffic rules, which cannot capture irregular maneuvers (e.g., nudging, U-turns) and complex interactions (e.g., yielding, merging). In contrast, we leverage real-world data to learn directly from human demonstration, and thus capture more naturalistic driving behaviors. To this end, we propose TrafficSim, a multi-agent behavior model for realistic traffic simulation. In particular, we parameterize the policy with an implicit latent variable model that generates socially-consistent plans for all actors in the scene jointly. To learn a robust policy amenable for long horizon simulation, we unroll the policy in training and optimize through the fully differentiable simulation across time. Our learning objective incorporates both human demonstrations as well as common sense. We show TrafficSim generates significantly more realistic traffic scenarios as compared to a diverse set of baselines. Notably, we can exploit trajectories generated by TrafficSim as effective data augmentation for training better motion planner.","citations":3,"title":"TrafficSim: Learning To Simulate Realistic Multi-Agent Behaviors","twitter":{"likes":10,"replies":1,"retweets":2,"ids":["1353011637913960448","1353445771367108609","1351555145558056961","1351453970322096128","1351358885811154957"]},"id":"353d6492-15b9-5a7c-a9f7-4348a6d9ee95","s2id":"9868cbb66312c7790602d4e3fe44af1482d5ce54","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Suo_TrafficSim_Learning_To_Simulate_Realistic_Multi-Agent_Behaviors_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Simon Suo","Sebastian Regalado","Sergio Casas","Raquel Urtasun"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06557"}},{"node":{"abstract":"4D reconstruction and rendering of human activities is critical for immersive VR/AR experience.

Recent works have shown that geometric deep learning can be used on mesh-based representations of proteins to identify potential functional sites, such as binding targets for potential drugs. Unfortunately though, the use of meshes as the underlying representation for protein structure has multiple drawbacks including the need to pre-compute the input features and mesh connectivities. This becomes a bottleneck for many important tasks in protein science. In this paper, we present a new framework for deep learning on protein structures that addresses these limitations. Among the key advantages of our method are the computation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the underlying atomic point cloud and a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. As a result, we are able to process large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fashion, taking as the sole input the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of their atoms, eliminating the need for any hand-crafted pre-computed features. To showcase the performance of our approach, we test it on two tasks in the field of protein structural bioinformatics: the identification of interaction sites and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. On both tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with much faster run times and fewer parameters than previous models.

Although the local and global structures often depend on each other and their simultaneous modeling is important, many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches interchange representations in different resolutions only a few times. In this paper, we claim the importance of a dense simultaneous modeling of multiresolution representation and propose a novel CNN architecture called densely connected multidilated DenseNet (D3Net). D3Net involves a novel multidilated convolution that has different dilation factors in a single layer to model different resolutions simultaneously. By combining the multidilated convolution with the DenseNet architecture, D3Net incorporates multiresolution learning with an exponentially growing receptive field in almost all layers, while avoiding the aliasing problem that occurs when we naively incorporate the dilated convolution in DenseNet.

We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality.

We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novelneural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODswith sparse octree traversal.

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor, in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be fairly simple and intuitive. The extensive analysis reveals that the proposed method successfully extracts contextually important features, and thus outperforms existing methods by large margins (5.37 mAP on HICO-DET, and 5.6 mAP on V-COCO).

Previous methods enforce independent gradient constraints for different tasks, while we consider these gradients contain complex information, and propose to leverage inter-task information by gradient decomposition. In particular, the gradient of an old task is decomposed into a part shared by all old tasks and a part specific to that task. The gradient for update should be close to the gradient of the new task, consistent with the gradients shared by all old tasks, and orthogonal to the space spanned by the gradients specific to the old tasks. In this way, our approach will encourage common knowledge consolidation but will not impair the task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the optimization is performed for the gradients of each layer separately rather than the concatenation of all gradients as in previous works. This effectively avoids the influence of the magnitude variation of the gradients in different layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both gradient-decomposed optimization and layer-wise updates. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks of continual learning.","citations":1,"title":"Layerwise Optimization by Gradient Decomposition for Continual Learning","twitter":{"likes":2,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1394471347212984323"]},"id":"07a1fd00-33b5-5c8d-86b8-6e96d581d823","s2id":"802d7cfbecd6b0176310f6791d9dbaffca7b4eca","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Tang_Layerwise_Optimization_by_Gradient_Decomposition_for_Continual_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Shixiang Tang","Dapeng Chen","Jinguo Zhu","Shijie Yu","Wanli Ouyang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07561"}},{"node":{"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of building pixel-wise dense correspondences between human images under arbitrary camera viewpoints and body poses.

But they require an extra fine-tuning stage, and the disjointed optimization of representation and classifier might lead to suboptimal results. However, end-to-end training methods, like equalization loss (EQL), still perform worse than decoupled training methods. In this paper, we reveal the main issue in long-tailed object detection is the imbalanced gradients between positives and negatives, and find that EQL does not solve it well. To address the problem of imbalanced gradients, we introduce a new version of equalization loss, called equalization loss v2 (EQL v2), a novel gradient guided reweighing mechanism that re-balances the training process for each category independently and equally. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging LVIS benchmark. EQL v2 outperforms origin EQL by about 4 points overall AP with 14 - 18 points improvements on the rare categories. More importantly, it also surpasses decoupled training methods. Without further tuning for the Open Images dataset, EQL v2 improves EQL by 7.3 points AP, showing strong generalization ability.

This paper introduces the first deep learning based approach to remove such artifacts from freely-shot photos. Specifically, given a wide-angle portrait as input, we build a cascaded network consisting of a LineNet, a ShapeNet, and a transition module (TM), which corrects perspective distortions on the background, adapts to the stereographic projection on facial regions, and achieves smooth transitions between these two projections, accordingly. To train our network, we build the first perspective portrait dataset with a large diversity in identities, scenes and camera modules. For the quantitative evaluation, we introduce two novel metrics, line consistency and face congruence.

We propose a transferability metric called Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy (OTCE), to analytically predict the transfer performance for supervised classification tasks in such cross-domain and cross-task feature transfer settings. Our OTCE score characterizes transferability as a combination of domain difference and task difference, and explicitly evaluates them from data in a unified framework. Specifically, we use optimal transport to estimate domain difference and the optimal coupling between source and target distributions, which is then used to derive the conditional entropy of the target task (task difference). Experiments on the largest cross-domain dataset DomainNet and Office31 demonstrate that OTCE shows an average of 21% gain in the correlation with the ground truth transfer accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask annotations.

Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations.

One main issue, widely known to the community, is that object boundaries derived only from 2D image appearance are ambiguous and unreliable. To address this, we exploit LiDAR clues to aid unsupervised object detection. By exploiting the 3D scene structure, the issue of localization can be considerably mitigated. We further identify another major issue, seldom noticed by the community, that the long-tailed and open-ended (sub-)category distribution should be accommodated. In this paper, we present the first practical method for unsupervised object detection with the aid of LiDAR clues. In our approach, candidate object segments based on 3D point clouds are firstly generated. Then, an iterative segment labeling process is conducted to assign segment labels and to train a segment labeling network, which is based on features from both 2D images and 3D point clouds. The labeling process is carefully designed so as to mitigate the issue of long-tailed and open-ended distribution. The final segment labels are set as pseudo annotations for object detection network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open dataset suggest that the derived unsupervised object detection method achieves reasonable accuracy compared with that of strong supervision within the LiDAR visible range.","citations":null,"title":"Unsupervised Object Detection With LIDAR Clues","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1332217630644572160","1331882644984930304","1331872098885754881"]},"id":"528437c3-4556-5778-b81b-936c787e9586","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Tian_Unsupervised_Object_Detection_With_LIDAR_Clues_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Hao Tian","Yuntao Chen","Jifeng Dai","Zhaoxiang Zhang","Xizhou Zhu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12953"}},{"node":{"abstract":"The goal of cross-view image based geo-localization is to determine the location of a given street view image by matching it against a collection of geo-tagged satellite images.

Following this observation, we propose a novel multi-task architecture in which image synthesis and retrieval are considered jointly. The rationale behind this is that we can bias our network to learn latent feature representations that are useful for retrieval if we utilize them to generate images across the two input domains. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that creates realistic street views from satellite images and localizes the corresponding query street view simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.

Event cameras are novel sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency. Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the key-frames.

Our method is based on retrieving an existing shape from a database of 3D models and then deforming its parts to match the target shape. Unlike previous approaches that independently focus on either shape retrieval or deformation, we propose a joint learning procedure that simultaneously trains the neural deformation module along with the embedding space used by the retrieval module. This enables our network to learn a deformation-aware embedding space, so that retrieved models are more amenable to match the target after an appropriate deformation. In fact, we use the embedding space to guide the shape pairs used to train the deformation module, so that it invests its capacity in learning deformations between meaningful shape pairs. Furthermore, our novel part-aware deformation module can work with inconsistent and diverse part-structures on the source shapes. We demonstrate the benefits of our joint training not only on our novel framework, but also on other state-of-the-art neural deformation modules proposed in recent years.

For the Questioner, we share the state-estimator from pretrained Guesser with Questioner to guide the question generator.

Each building is assigned a unique identifier (i.e. address), which permits tracking of individual objects over time. Label fidelity exceeds image resolution; this \"omniscient labeling\" is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surprisingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demonstrate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization.

We propose a self-supervised approach that learns a single image 3D pose estimator from unlabeled multi-view data. To this end, we exploit multi-view consistency constraints to disentangle the observed 2D pose into the underlying 3D pose and camera rotation. In contrast to most existing methods, we do not require calibrated cameras and can therefore learn from moving cameras. Nevertheless, in the case of a static camera setup, we present an optional extension to include constant relative camera rotations over multiple views into our framework. Key to the success are new, unbiased reconstruction objectives that mix information across views and training samples. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets (Human3.6M and MPII-INF-3DHP) and on the in-the-wild SkiPose dataset.","citations":3,"title":"CanonPose: Self-Supervised Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild","twitter":{"likes":20,"replies":2,"retweets":4,"ids":["1366602760964083713"]},"id":"db7cb9f3-ed0f-55eb-8297-cf4e71c0a659","s2id":"094b1c9bfd4ae833bac080032cd91813da42ee17","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wandt_CanonPose_Self-Supervised_Monocular_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Bastian Wandt","Marco Rudolph","Petrissa Zell","Helge Rhodin","Bodo Rosenhahn"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14679"}},{"node":{"abstract":"3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on difficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D object detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures do not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use the estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware self-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the autonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant margins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting). For example, when training using only 10% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7 absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5 absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon the prior art. On KITTI, we are the first to demonstrate semi-supervised 3D object detection and our method surpasses a fully supervised baseline from 1.8% to 7.6% under different label ratio and categories.","citations":1,"title":"3DIoUMatch: Leveraging IoU Prediction for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection","twitter":{"likes":26,"replies":0,"retweets":7,"ids":["1347671479970799616","1336705019345653760"]},"id":"1cc47e90-05db-59ba-a4ba-abfd6dc68a52","s2id":"567579b22251c493bcc85c6bbb73f1a87be5bce4","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_3DIoUMatch_Leveraging_IoU_Prediction_for_Semi-Supervised_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["He Wang","Yezhen Cong","Or Litany","Yue Gao","Leonidas J.

Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot catch temporal relationships; 3D CNNs can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive. In this work, we tackle this dilemma by designing a generic and effective module that can be embedded into 2D CNNs. To this end, we propose a spAtio-temporal, Channel and moTion excitatION (ACTION) module consisting of three paths: Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE) path, Channel Excitation (CE) path, and Motion Excitation (ME) path. The STE path employs one channel 3D convolution to characterize spatio-temporal representation. The CE path adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels in terms of the temporal aspect. The ME path calculates feature-level temporal differences, which is then utilized to excite motion-sensitive channels. We equip 2D CNNs with the proposed ACTION module to form a simple yet effective ACTION-Net with very limited extra computational cost. ACTION-Net is demonstrated by consistently outperforming 2D CNN counterparts on three backbones (i.e., ResNet-50, MobileNet V2 and BNInception) employing three datasets (i.e., Something-Something V2, Jester, and EgoGesture).

In particular, when a model consecutively learns from different visual domains, it tends to forget the past domains in favor of the most recent ones. In this context, we show that one way to learn models that are inherently more robust against forgetting is domain randomization -- for vision tasks, randomizing the current domain's distribution with heavy image manipulations. Building on this result, we devise a meta-learning strategy where a regularizer explicitly penalizes any loss associated with transferring the model from the current domain to different \"auxiliary\" meta-domains, while also easing adaptation to them. Such meta-domains are also generated through randomized image manipulations. We empirically demonstrate in a variety of experiments -- spanning from classification to semantic segmentation -- that our approach results in models that are less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains.","citations":0,"title":"Continual Adaptation of Visual Representations via Domain Randomization and Meta-Learning","twitter":{"likes":67,"replies":3,"retweets":6,"ids":["1367219110770315269","1336504433140785156","1380323103809617924","1336596113131008000"]},"id":"1f93e28a-8d18-5565-ab56-e7663ef84d9b","s2id":"7b332de15ba865284fbd2c7943ca3110bc067ef7","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Volpi_Continual_Adaptation_of_Visual_Representations_via_Domain_Randomization_and_Meta-Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Riccardo Volpi","Diane Larlus","Gregory Rogez"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04324"}},{"node":{"abstract":"As self-driving systems become better, simulating scenarios where the autonomy stack may fail becomes more important.

Two-stage NAS requires sampling from the search space during training, which directly impacts the accuracy of the final searched models.

Existing image captioning methods commonly target at generic images, and lack mechanism to meet this requirement. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a self-boosting framework that improves radiographic report generation based on the cooperation of the main task of report generation and anauxiliary task of image-text matching. The two tasks are built as the two branches of a network model and influence each other in a cooperative way. On one hand, the image-text matching branch helps to learn highly text-correlated visual features for the report generation branch to output high quality reports. One the other hand, the improved reports produced by the report generation branch provideadditional harder samples for the image-text matching task and enforce the latter to improve itself by learning better visual and text feature representations. This, in turn, helps improve the report generation branch again. These two branches are jointly trained to help improve each other iteratively and progressively, so that the whole model is self-boosted without requiring any external resources. Additionally, in the loss function, our model evaluates the quality of the generated reports not only on the word similarity as common approaches do (via minimizing a cross-entropy loss), but also on the feature similarity at high-level, while the latter is provided by the text-encoder of the image-text matching branch.

This paper proposes a robust and accurate method that effectively exploits the anatomical knowledge of the spine to facilitate vertebra localization and identification. A key point localization model is trained to produce activation maps of vertebra centers. They are then re-sampled along the spine centerline to produce spine-rectified activation maps, which are further aggregated into 1-D activation signals. Following this, an anatomically-constrained optimization module is introduced to jointly search for the optimal vertebra centers under a soft constraint that regulates the distance between vertebrae and a hard constraint on the consecutive vertebra indices.

These pre-trained models can be sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks due to the discrepancy between image-level prediction and pixel-level prediction. To fill this gap, we aim to design an effective, dense self-supervised learning method that directly works at the level of pixels (or local features) by taking into account the correspondence between local features. We present dense contrastive learning, which implements self-supervised learning by optimizing a pairwise contrastive (dis)similarity loss at the pixel level between two views of input images. Compared to the baseline method MoCo-v2, our method introduces negligible computation overhead (only <1% slower), but demonstrates consistently superior performance when transferring to downstream dense prediction tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation; and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, over the strong MoCo-v2 baseline, our method achieves significant improvements of 2.0% AP on PASCAL VOC object detection, 1.1% AP on COCO object detection, 0.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, 3.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation and 1.8% mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation.

Motivated by the viewpoint that attention reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the recognition process, this paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate visually-natural physical adversarial camouflage with strong transferability by suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate transferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar attention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on the fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g., suspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to generate visually-natural camouflage which is correlated to the scenario context.

Though adversarial attacks have achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting, especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation, instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation, we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations. Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods, improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1%.

The BMR is improved by the end-task and KD losses in an end-to-end manner. Second, we leverage the structural similarities of both modalities and adapt the knowledge by matching their distributions. Moreover, as most prior feature KD methods are uni-modality and less applicable to our problem, we propose an affinity graph KD and other losses to boost the distillation.

The former two rely on the image content, while fluency is purely related to linguistics and more subjective.

Since image captioning involves two different modalities, we employ the scene graph as a bridge between them to represent both images and captions. FAIEr mainly regards the visual scene graph as the criterion to measure the fidelity. Then for evaluating the adequacy of the candidate caption, it highlights the image gist on the visual scene graph under the guidance of the reference captions.

However, the deep learning based visual-audio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At present, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished with real fixations being recorded in the real visual-audio environment. Hence, it would be neither efficiency nor necessary to re-collect real fixations under the same visual-audio circumstance. To address the problem, this paper advocate a novel approach in a weakly-supervised manner to alleviating the demand of large-scale training sets for visual-audio model training.

The current top-performing deep learning-based methods rely on an indirect strategy, i.e., first establishing 2D-3D correspondences between the coordinates in the image plane and object coordinate system, and then applying a variant of the PnP/RANSAC algorithm. However, this two-stage pipeline is not end-to-end trainable, thus is hard to be employed for many tasks requiring differentiable poses. On the other hand, methods based on direct regression are currently inferior to geometry-based methods. In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation on both direct and indirect methods, and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDR-Net) to learn the 6D pose in an end-to-end manner from dense correspondence-based intermediate geometric representations.

A new formulation is proposed under the assumption of an optimal student, where optimality is defined in the usual machine learning sense of empirical risk minimization. This is a sensible assumption for machine learning students and for human students in crowdsourcing platforms, who tend to perform at least as well as machine learning systems. It is shown that, if allowed unbounded effort, the optimal student always learns the optimal predictor for a classification task. Hence, the role of the optimal teacher is to select the teaching set that minimizes student effort. This is formulated as a problem of functional optimization where, at each teaching iteration, the teacher seeks to align the steepest descent directions of the risk of (1) the teaching set and (2) entire example population. The optimal teacher, denoted MaxGrad, is then shown to maximize the gradient of the risk on the set of new examples selected per iteration. MaxGrad teaching algorithms are finally provided for both binary and multiclass tasks, and shown to have some similarities with boosting algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MaxGrad, which outperforms previous algorithms on the classification task, for both machine learning and human students from MTurk, by a substantial margin.","citations":null,"title":"Gradient-Based Algorithms for Machine Teaching","twitter":null,"id":"8d15a0a5-3528-5c51-99f0-73b73533217a","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Gradient-Based_Algorithms_for_Machine_Teaching_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Pei Wang","Kabir Nagrecha","Nuno Vasconcelos"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show increasing performance and the level of realism is becoming indistinguishable from natural images, this also comes with high demands on data and computation.

In this paper, we approach the problem with deep clustering, where the key idea is to learn part priors from a dataset with fine-grained segmentation but no part annotations. Given point sampled 3D shapes, we model the clustering priors of points with a similarity matrix and achieve part-based segmentation through minimizing a novel low rank loss. Further, since fine-grained parts can be very tiny, a 3D shape has to be densely sampled to ensure the tiny parts are well captured and segmented. To handle densely sampled point sets, we adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme. We first partition the large point set into a number of blocks. Each block is segmented using a deep-clustering-based part prior network (PriorNet) trained in a category-agnostic manner.

We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, despite recent effort on rotation representation learning in neural networks, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and result in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses.","citations":3,"title":"Locally Aware Piecewise Transformation Fields for 3D Human Mesh Registration","twitter":{"likes":30,"replies":1,"retweets":6,"ids":["1387875101941682192","1386244602890317827"]},"id":"1db235cc-ad74-5ff0-a884-c33edb194b78","s2id":"bd3357341ca482665a2e101b426125365a0f4852","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Locally_Aware_Piecewise_Transformation_Fields_for_3D_Human_Mesh_Registration_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Shaofei Wang","Andreas Geiger","Siyu Tang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08160"}},{"node":{"abstract":"To capture high-speed videos using a two-dimensional detector, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising system, where the video frames are coded by different masks and then compressed to a snapshot measurement.

However, these networks are usually trained for specific small-scale masks and often have high demands of training time and GPU memory, which are hence not flexible to i) a new mask with the same size and ii) a larger-scale mask. We address these challenges by developing a Meta Modulated Convolutional Network for SCI reconstruction, dubbed MetaSCI.

In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal 3D object detection algorithm, named PointAugmenting.

On the other hand, PointAugmenting benefits from a novel cross-modal data augmentation algorithm, which consistently pastes virtual objects into images and point clouds during network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our PointAugmenting.

However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better? To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions-deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise (Arpit et al., 2017) and minimum entropy regularisation principle (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2006)-we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings.

Moreover, the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for flexible targeted attack.

Surprisingly, however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of learned weights for the task of style transfer.","citations":1,"title":"Rethinking and Improving the Robustness of Image Style Transfer","twitter":{"likes":110,"replies":2,"retweets":12,"ids":["1381993799488995333","1381813268826705922","1382616565049294848","1383089473253212164"]},"id":"9bb8ed92-e254-5847-933d-4cf591151d65","s2id":"981239bc3b93af0e9913d05ffb2aca1edbe216fe","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Rethinking_and_Improving_the_Robustness_of_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Pei Wang","Yijun Li","Nuno Vasconcelos"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05623"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Video quality assessment for User Generated Content (UGC) is an important topic in both industry and academia.

The overwhelming gradients of negative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for classifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be misclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we propose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and negative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e., mitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces punishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training instances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor increases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of tail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with mainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies.

To balance plasticity and stability of network in continual learning, in this paper, we propose a novel network training algorithm called Adam-NSCL, which sequentially optimizes network parameters in the null space of previous tasks. We first propose two mathematical conditions respectively for achieving network stability and plasticity in continual learning. Based on them, the network training for sequential tasks can be simply achieved by projecting the candidate parameter update into the approximate null space of all previous tasks in the network training process, where the candidate parameter update can be generated by Adam. The approximate null space can be derived by applying singular value decomposition to the uncentered covariance matrix of all input features of previous tasks for each linear layer. For efficiency, the uncentered covariance matrix can be incrementally computed after learning each task. We also empirically verify the rationality of the approximate null space at each linear layer. We apply our approach to training networks for continual learning on benchmark datasets of CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, and the results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms or matches the state-ot-the-art continual learning approaches.","citations":0,"title":"Training Networks in Null Space of Feature Covariance for Continual Learning","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1371368372240314375","1371263396411232257"]},"id":"416d283f-968a-5aa0-ad13-62016a696ca9","s2id":"ea5f7e806d870f237d9556d37a307ef0d9905ac7","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Training_Networks_in_Null_Space_of_Feature_Covariance_for_Continual_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Shipeng Wang","Xiaorong Li","Jian Sun","Zongben Xu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07113"}},{"node":{"abstract":"In video object tracking, there exist rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which have been largely overlooked in existing trackers. In this work, we bridge the individual video frames and explore the temporal contexts across them via a transformer architecture for robust object tracking. Different from classic usage of the transformer in natural language processing tasks, we separate its encoder and decoder into two parallel branches and carefully design them within the Siamese-like tracking pipelines. The transformer encoder promotes the target templates via attention-based feature reinforcement, which benefits the high-quality tracking model generation. The transformer decoder propagates the tracking cues from previous templates to the current frame, which facilitates the object searching process. Our transformer-assisted tracking framework is neat and trained in an end-to-end manner. With the proposed transformer, a simple Siamese matching approach is able to outperform the current top-performing trackers.

In this paper, we concentrate on the understanding of the behaviours of unsupervised contrastive loss. We will show that the contrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function, and the temperature t controls the strength of penalties on hard negative samples. The previous study has shown that uniformity is a key property of contrastive learning. We build relations between the uniformity and the temperature t. We will show that uniformity helps the contrastive learning to learn separable features, however excessive pursuit to the uniformity makes the contrastive loss not tolerant to semantically similar samples, which may break the underlying semantic structure and be harmful to the formation of features useful for downstream tasks. This is caused by the inherent defect of the instance discrimination objective. Specifically, instance discrimination objective tries to push all different instances apart, ignoring the underlying relations between samples. Pushing semantically consistent samples apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior informative to general downstream tasks. A well-designed contrastive loss should have some extents of tolerance to the closeness of semantically similar samples. Therefore, we find that the contrastive loss meets a uniformity-tolerance dilemma, and a good choice of temperature can compromise these two properties properly to both learn separable features and tolerant to semantically similar samples, improving the feature qualities and the downstream performances.","citations":5,"title":"Understanding the Behaviour of Contrastive Loss","twitter":null,"id":"81331804-3b16-5cf2-adc0-8487eeb62359","s2id":"57eaad10369de402d3363c1d99c93810463eb03c","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Understanding_the_Behaviour_of_Contrastive_Loss_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Feng Wang","Huaping Liu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09740"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Recently, the group maximum differentiation competition (gMAD) has been used to improve blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models, with the help of full-reference metrics.

However, natural data could be highly correlated and long-tail distributed. Natural between-instance similarity conflicts with the presumed instance distinction, causing unstable training and poor performance. Our idea is to discover and integrate between-instance similarity into contrastive learning, not directly by instance grouping, but by cross-level discrimination (CLD) between instances and local instance groups. While invariant mapping of each instance is imposed by attraction within its augmented views, between-instance similarity emerges from common repulsion against instance groups. Our batch-wise and cross-view comparisons also greatly improve the positive/negative sample ratio of contrastive learning and achieve better invariant mapping. To effect both grouping and discrimination objectives, we impose them on features separately derived from a shared representation. In addition, we propose normalized projection heads and unsupervised hyper-parameter tuning for the first time. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that CLD is a lean and powerful add-on to existing methods (e.g., NPID, MoCo, InfoMin, BYOL) on highly correlated, long-tail, or balanced datasets. It not only achieves new state-of-the-art on self-supervision, semi-supervision, and transfer learning benchmarks, but also beats MoCo v2 and SimCLR on every reported performance attained with a much larger compute. CLD effectively extends unsupervised learning to natural data and brings it closer to real-world applications.","citations":0,"title":"Unsupervised Feature Learning by Cross-Level Instance-Group Discrimination","twitter":{"likes":28,"replies":1,"retweets":5,"ids":["1335852532178976768","1313549876018503686","1313293257036697601","1314917291793035265","1293091636415795201","1313489498551050241","1295868338749558785","1295717557404672015","1295536179396390915","1293233568936861697","1293180724963614720","1293014486484430859","1292999304890716160"]},"id":"198fbc4a-a018-596f-a478-c6e83f13de26","s2id":"ce0fc0cc8a7eda062dd6a7f1c85a4e92048f90a3","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Unsupervised_Feature_Learning_by_Cross-Level_Instance-Group_Discrimination_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Xudong Wang","Ziwei Liu","Stella X.

However, most methods ignore the gap between natural images and scene text images and directly apply ImageNet for pre-training. To address such a problem, some of them firstly pre-train the model using a large amount of synthetic data and then fine-tune it on target datasets, which is task-specific and has limited generalization capability. In this paper, we focus on providing general pre-trained models for text detectors. Considering the importance of exploring text contents for text detection, we propose STKM (Self-attention based Text Knowledge Mining), which consists of a CNN Encoder and a Self-attention Decoder, to learn general prior knowledge for text detection from SynthText. Given only image level text labels, Self-attention Decoder directly decodes features extracted from CNN Encoder to texts without requirement of detection, which guides the CNN backbone to explicitly learn discriminative semantic representations ignored by previous approaches. After that, the text knowledge learned by the backbone can be transferred to various text detectors to significantly improve their detection performance (e.g., 5.89% higher F-measure for EAST on ICDAR15 dataset) without bells and whistles.

Most existing matting methods leverage a user-supplied trimap as an auxiliary input to produce good alpha matte. However, obtaining high-quality trimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods. Recently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality is still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without the trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which is the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective procedure and depends on the user's intention. To this end, this paper proposes an improved deep image matting framework which is trimap-free and only needs several user click interactions to eliminate the ambiguity. Moreover, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation module that can predict which parts need polishing and a following local refinement module. Based on the computation budget, users can choose how many local parts to improve with the uncertainty guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method performs better than existing trimap-free methods and comparably to state-of-the-art trimap-based methods with minimal user effort.","citations":0,"title":"Improved Image Matting via Real-Time User Clicks and Uncertainty Estimation","twitter":{"likes":24,"replies":0,"retweets":5,"ids":["1339080058443624449","1339425668795285504"]},"id":"4c6e8f29-4193-5c3a-95c3-2aa27a427556","s2id":"aee8a56202088c2a51dc6f858c1bdd07c405e000","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wei_Improved_Image_Matting_via_Real-Time_User_Clicks_and_Uncertainty_Estimation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Tianyi Wei","Dongdong Chen","Wenbo Zhou","Jing Liao","Hanqing Zhao","Weiming Zhang","Nenghai Yu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08323"}},{"node":{"abstract":"For unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), to alleviate the effect of domain shift, many approaches align the source and target domains in the feature space by adversarial learning or by explicitly aligning their statistics.

This will reduce the effectiveness of domain alignment in improving the performance of UDA. In this paper, we aim to study and alleviate the optimization inconsistency problem between the domain alignment and classification tasks. We address this by proposing an effective meta-optimization based strategy dubbed MetaAlign, where we treat the domain alignment objective and the classification objective as the meta-train and meta-test tasks in a meta-learning scheme. MetaAlign encourages both tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way, which maximizes the inner product of the gradients of the two tasks during training.

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow feature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate WSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shallow layers. In practice, our SPOL model first generates the CAMs through a novel element-wise multiplication of shallow and deep feature maps, which filters the background noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further propose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate object mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any extra annotation. Eventually, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object mask to locate the target.

Our study reveals two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely constrained by the victim model's dependence on key facial features. Second, four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses.

The philosophy of off-the-shelf approaches lies in the augmentation of unpaired data, i.e. first generating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images Y^g corresponding to real-world high-resolution (HR) images X^r in the real-world LR domain Y^r, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs Y^g, X^r for training in a supervised manner. Unfortunately, since image translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance of these approaches is severely limited by the domain gap between generated synthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised real-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g. Y^g) and testing data (e.g. Y^r) is addressed with our domain-gap aware training and domain-distance weighted supervision strategies. Domain-gap aware training takes additional benefit from real data in the target domain while domain-distance weighted supervision brings forward the more rational use of labeled source domain data.

Thanks to invertible flow transformations, latent codes that encode deep properties of motion styles are efficiently inferred by M. By combining the latent codes (from an input style motion S) with the autoregressive context and control signal (from an input content motion C), M outputs a stylized motion which transfers style from S to C. Moreover, our model is probabilistic and is able to generate various plausible motions with a specific style.

A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover. It moves move each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore, PMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the constraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a strict and unique correspondence on point-level, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which demonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.

However, most of the prior arts along this line (a) merely adopt local information to perform modality alignment and (b) ignore the diversity of learning difficulty across different subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to jointly address the above-mentioned issues. Targeting at (a), we propose a two-level modality alignment loss where both global and local information are considered. Compared with the existing methods, we introduce a global loss into the modality alignment process. The global component of the loss is driven by the accuracy of the identity classification. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the loss could maximize the distance between embeddings across different identities while minimizing the distance between embeddings belonging to the same identity, in a global sense (instead of a mini-batch). Targeting at (b), we propose a dynamic reweighting scheme to better explore the hard but valuable identities while filtering out the unlearnable and noisy identities.

However, existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets, while real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push adversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed distributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness, uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction with the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are obtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated modules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin engineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art defense methods.

However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation network (DANNet) for nighttime semantic segmentation without using labeled nighttime image data. It employs an adversarial training with a labeled daytime dataset and an unlabeled dataset that contains coarsely aligned day-night image pairs. Specifically, for the unlabeled day-night image pairs, we use the pixel-level predictions of static object categories on a daytime image as a pseudo supervision to segment its counterpart nighttime image. We further design a re-weighting strategy to handle the inaccuracy caused by misalignment between day-night image pairs and wrong predictions of daytime images, as well as boost the prediction accuracy of small objects. The proposed DANNet is the first one stage adaptation framework for nighttime semantic segmentation, which does not train additional day-night image transfer models as a separate pre-processing stage.

To explore more comprehensive class-specific activation maps, we propose an Embedded Discriminative Attention Mechanism (EDAM) by integrating the activation map generation into the classification network directly for WSSS. Specifically, a Discriminative Activation (DA) layer is designed to explicitly produce a series of normalized class-specific masks, which are then used to generate class-specific pixel-level pseudo-labels demanded in segmentation. For learning the pseudo-labels, the masks are multiplied with the feature maps after the backbone to generate the discriminative activation maps, each of which encodes the specific information of the corresponding category in the input images. Given such class-specific activation maps, a Collaborative Multi-Attention (CMA) module is proposed to extract the collaborative information of each given category from images in a batch. In inference, we directly use the activation masks from the DA layer as pseudo-labels for segmentation. Based on the generated pseudo-labels, we achieve the mIoU of 70:60% on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation test set, which is the new state-of-the-art, to our best knowledge.

The task is challenging since there only exist video-level event labels for training, without indicating the temporal boundaries and modalities. Previous works take the overall event labels to supervise both audio and visual model predictions. However, we argue that such overall labels harm the model training due to the audio-visual asynchrony. For example, commentators speak in a basketball video, but we cannot visually find the speakers. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the cross-modal correspondence of audio and visual signals. We generate reliable event labels individually for each modality by swapping audio and visual tracks with other unrelated videos. If the original visual/audio data contain event clues, the event prediction from the newly assembled data would still be highly confident. In this way, we could protect our models from being misled by ambiguous event labels. In addition, we propose the cross-modal audio-visual contrastive learning to induce temporal difference on attention models within videos, i.e., urging the model to pick the current temporal segment from all context candidates.

In parallel, deep hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end optimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of large-scale video prediction.

To investigate the robustness of DNNs, transfer-based attacks have attracted a growing interest recently due to their high practical applicability, where attackers craft adversarial samples with local models and employ the resultant samples to attack a remote black-box model. However, existing transfer-based attacks frequently suffer from low success rates due to overfitting to the adopted local model.

A key question for this forecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up to the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide an answer with a novel framework, namely Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL), which exploits the irreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically, based on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction of the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal image, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given the progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To model these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in DFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the disease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the future image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image. The generative model is implemented by a recurrent neural network, in order to exploit the dependency of the historical data. To verify our approach, we apply it to a PPA in-house dataset and it yields a significant improvement (e.g., 4.48% of accuracy; 3.45% of AUC) over others.

The key idea is to use dual information, such as spatial and spectral, or local and global features, in a complementary and effective way, and extract more accurate information from current iteration to use for the next iteration. In each DIR iteration, starting from current correspondence, a zoom-in process at each point is used to select well matched anchor pairs by a local mapping distortion criterion. These selected anchor pairs are then used to align spectral features (or other appropriate global features) whose dimension adaptively matches the capacity of the selected anchor pairs. Thanks to the effective combination of complementary information in a data-adaptive way, DIR is not only efficient but also robust to render accurate results within a few iterations. By choosing appropriate dual features, DIR has the flexibility to handle patch and partial matching as well. Extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of DIR over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","citations":0,"title":"A Dual Iterative Refinement Method for Non-Rigid Shape Matching","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1329797459934121984","1330612304384241665","1330430988049113096","1330234878382792706","1330038556824375296","1329993063004049408","1329615624545439744","1288137378029342720","1288122136549179395","1288007294345719809","1287944439277613056","1287925954610966534"]},"id":"8fc0522c-0fcc-59ad-afbe-9150dadd05cc","s2id":"2fbe8e9280f6c0817ab77d1d2791ef835c65e56e","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Xiang_A_Dual_Iterative_Refinement_Method_for_Non-Rigid_Shape_Matching_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Friday","authors":["Rui Xiang","Rongjie Lai","Hongkai Zhao"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13049"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present a method that learns a spatiotemporal neural irradiance field for dynamic scenes from a single video.

Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches. However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in the black-box setting.

Existing FSS methods find the query object by using support prototypes or by directly relying on heuristic multi-scale feature fusion. However, they fail to fully leverage the high-order appearance relationships between multi-scale features among the support-query image pairs, thus leading to an inaccurate localization of the query objects. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end scale-aware graph neural network (SAGNN) by reasoning the cross-scale relations among the support-query images for FSS. Specifically, a scale-aware graph is first built by taking support-induced multi-scale query features as nodes and, meanwhile, each edge is modeled as the pairwise interaction of its connected nodes. By progressive message passing over this graph, SAGNN is capable of capturing cross-scale relations and overcoming object variations (e.g., appearance, scale and location), and can thus learn more precise node embeddings. This in turn enables it to predict more accurate foreground objects. Moreover, to make full use of the location relations across scales for the query image, a novel self-node collaboration mechanism is proposed to enrich the current node, which endows SAGNN the ability of perceiving different resolutions of the same objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that SAGNN achieves state-of-the-art results.","citations":null,"title":"Scale-Aware Graph Neural Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation","twitter":null,"id":"ca1093ce-2824-5560-9a11-41ca74cc5a40","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Xie_Scale-Aware_Graph_Neural_Network_for_Few-Shot_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Guo-Sen Xie","Jie Liu","Huan Xiong","Ling Shao"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a novel Style-based Point Generator with Adversarial Rendering (SpareNet) for point cloud completion.

In this paper, we introduce pixel-level pretext tasks for learning dense feature representations. The first task directly applies contrastive learning at the pixel level. We additionally propose a pixel-to-propagation consistency task that produces better results, even surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Specifically, it achieves 60.2 AP, 41.4 / 40.5 mAP and 77.2 mIoU when transferred to Pascal VOC object detection (C4), COCO object detection (FPN / C4) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation using a ResNet-50 backbone network, which are 2.6 AP, 0.8 / 1.0 mAP and 1.0 mIoU better than the previous best methods built on instance-level contrastive learning. Moreover, the pixel-level pretext tasks are found to be effective for pre-training not only regular backbone networks but also head networks used for dense downstream tasks, and are complementary to instance-level contrastive methods. These results demonstrate the strong potential of defining pretext tasks at the pixel level, and suggest a new path forward in unsupervised visual representation learning.

We decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the re-id model in a multi-branch network.

Traditional training mechanism optimizes the overall discriminativeness of the whole feature. It may stop early when some feature elements has been trained to distinguish training samples well, leaving other elements insufficiently trained for a feature. This would result in a less generalizable feature extractor that only captures major discriminative cues and ignores subtle ones. Therefore, there is a need for a training mechanism that enforces the discriminativeness of all the elements in the feature to capture more the subtle visual cues. In this paper, we propose a Discrimination-Aware Mechanism (DAM) that iteratively identifies insufficiently trained elements and improves them. DAM is able to increase the number of well learned elements, which captures more visual cues by the feature extractor. In this way, a more informative representation is learned, which brings better generalization performance. We show that DAM can be easily applied to both proxy-based and pair-based loss functions, and thus can be used in most existing fine-grained recognition paradigms.

In this paper, we present a new system for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new geometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies between them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD operations, unlike prior work using CSG with parametric primitives. We focus on CAD programs consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are common in CAD practice. We phrase our problem as search in the space of such extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to score potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search.

Most of the existing methods for feature alignment in few-shot learning only consider image-level or spatial-level alignment while omitting the channel disparity. Our insight is that these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and leveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned knowledge to new classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn a dynamic alignment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and channels according to different local support information. Specifically, this is achieved by first dynamically sampling the neighbourhood of the feature position conditioned on the input few shot, based on which we further predict a both position-dependent and channel-dependent Dynamic Meta-filter. The filter is used to align the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific knowledge. Moreover, we adopt Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to enable a more accurate control of the alignment. In such a sense our model is able to better capture fine-grained semantic context of the few-shot example and thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning.

This task, however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1) it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase; 2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method. Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor, we group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph (ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct the multi-view caption generation to improve the content diversity of generated captions. Experimental results show that our method not only achieves SOTA performance but also generates diverse captions to describe images.","citations":0,"title":"Towards Accurate Text-Based Image Captioning With Content Diversity Exploration","twitter":null,"id":"3e71e161-8e84-5c5c-b320-9b4d1c395180","s2id":"17e695d7b00600e0fd6599e1d7703d9f76e796e8","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Xu_Towards_Accurate_Text-Based_Image_Captioning_With_Content_Diversity_Exploration_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Guanghui Xu","Shuaicheng Niu","Mingkui Tan","Yucheng Luo","Qing Du","Qi Wu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03236"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We address the problem of estimating the 3D pose of a network of cameras for large-environment wide-baseline scenarios, e.g., cameras for construction sites, sports stadiums, and public spaces.

In such circumstances, treating people in the scene as \"keypoints\" and associating them across different camera views can be an alternative method for obtaining correspondences. Based on this intuition, we propose a method that uses ideas from person re-identification (re-ID) for wide-baseline camera calibration. Our method first employs a re-ID method to associate human bounding boxes across cameras, then converts bounding box correspondences to point correspondences, and finally solves for camera pose using multi-view geometry and bundle adjustment. Since our method does not require specialized calibration targets except for visible people, it applies to situations where frequent calibration updates are required. We perform extensive experiments on datasets captured from scenes of different sizes, camera settings (indoor and outdoor), and human activities (walking, playing basketball, construction).

In this work, we propose PseudoBinaural, an effective pipeline that is free of binaural recordings. The key insight is to carefully build pseudo visual-stereo pairs with mono data for training. Specifically, we leverage spherical harmonic decomposition and head-related impulse response (HRIR) to identify the relationship between the location of a sound source and the received binaural audio. Then in the visual modality, corresponding visual cues of the mono data are manually placed at sound source positions to form the pairs. Compared to fully-supervised paradigms, our binaural-recording-free pipeline shows great stability in the cross-dataset evaluation and comparable performance under subjective preference.

Furthermore, optimizing the model over brief clips impedes its ability to learn long-term temporal dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a collaborative memory mechanism that encodes information across multiple sampled clips of a video at each training iteration. This enables the learning of long-range dependencies beyond a single clip. We explore different design choices for the collaborative memory to ease the optimization difficulties.

It is found that the input latent space shows semantic correlations with the output image space. Recent works aim to interpret the latent space and discover meaningful directions that correspond to human interpretable image transformations. However, these methods either rely on explicit scores of attributes (e.g., memorability) or are restricted to binary ones (e.g., gender), which largely limits the applicability of editing tasks, especially for free-form artistic tasks like style/anime editing. In this paper, we propose an adversarial method, AdvStyle, for discovering interpretable directions in the absence of well-labeled scores or binary attributes. In particular, the proposed adversarial method simultaneously optimizes the discovered directions and the attribute assessor using the target attribute data as positive samples, while the generated ones being negative. In this way, arbitrary attributes can be edited by collecting positive data only, and the proposed method learns a controllable representation enabling manipulation of non-binary attributes like anime styles and facial characteristics. Moreover, the proposed learning strategy attenuates the entanglement between attributes, such that multiattribute manipulation can be easily achieved without any additional constraint. Furthermore, we reveal several interesting semantics with the involuntarily learned negative directions. Extensive experiments on 9 anime attributes and 7 human attributes demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial approach qualitatively and quantitatively.

To this end, we present a two-step pose estimation framework to attain 6DoF object poses from 2D object bounding-boxes. In the first step, the framework learns to segment objects from real and synthetic data in a weakly-supervised fashion, and the segmentation masks will act as a prior for pose estimation. In the second step, we design a dual-scale pose estimation network, namely DSC-PoseNet, to predict object poses by employing a differential renderer. To be specific, our DSC-PoseNet firstly predicts object poses in the original image scale by comparing the segmentation masks and the rendered visible object masks. Then, we resize object regions to a fixed scale to estimate poses once again. In this fashion, we eliminate large scale variations and focus on rotation estimation, thus facilitating pose estimation. Moreover, we exploit the initial pose estimation to generate pseudo ground-truth to train our DSC-PoseNet in a self-supervised manner. The estimation results in these two scales are ensembled as our final pose estimation.

The learned AU semantic embeddings are then used as guidance for the generation of attention maps through a cross-modality attention network. The generated cross-modality attention maps are further used as weights for the aggregated feature.

To learn new task without forgetting, recently, the mask-based learning method (e.g. piggyback ) is proposed to address these issues by learning only a binary element-wise mask, while keeping the backbone model fixed. However, the binary mask has limited modeling capacity for new tasks. A more recent work proposes a compress-grow-based method (CPG) to achieve better accuracy for new tasks by partially training backbone model, but with order-higher training cost, which makes it infeasible to be deployed into popular state-of-the-art edge-/mobile-learning. The primary goal of this work is to simultaneously achieve fast and high-accuracy multi-task adaption in a continual learning setting. Thus motivated, we propose a new training method called Kernel-wise Soft Mask (KSM), which learns a kernel-wise hybrid binary and real-value soft mask for each task. Such a soft mask can be viewed as a superposition of a binary mask and a properly scaled real-value tensor, which offers a richer representation capability without low-level kernel support to meet the objective of low hardware overhead. We validate KSM on multiple benchmark datasets against recent state-of-the-art methods (e.g. Piggyback, Packnet, CPG, etc.), which shows good improvement in both accuracy and training cost.","citations":0,"title":"KSM: Fast Multiple Task Adaption via Kernel-Wise Soft Mask Learning","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":1,"retweets":0,"ids":["1319809523931140108","1306050689244819456","1305966505373446148","1305879150478135296","1305764514051371014","1305764315782410240","1305711571667099648","1305697710914392064","1305693008474456064","1305686365984751616","1305683070805315591"]},"id":"2848cc43-e6d7-57f6-93b9-c84bc69a7fc3","s2id":"f513fd50710d762c0cbaf4f566ebb74defedb100","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Yang_KSM_Fast_Multiple_Task_Adaption_via_Kernel-Wise_Soft_Mask_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Li Yang","Zhezhi He","Junshan Zhang","Deliang Fan"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05668"}},{"node":{"abstract":"When translating text inputs into layouts or images, existing works typically require explicit descriptions of each object in a scene, including their spatial information or the associated relationships. To better exploit the text input, so that implicit objects or relationships can be properly inferred during layout generation, we propose a LayoutTransformer Network (LT-Net) in this paper. Given a scene-graph input, our LT-Net uniquely encodes the semantic features for exploiting their co-occurrences and implicit relationships. This allows one to manipulate conceptually diverse yet plausible layout outputs. Moreover, the decoder of our LT-Net translates the encoded contextual features into bounding boxes with self-supervised relation consistency preserved.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on first estimating poses in each frame and only then implementing data association and refinement. Despite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to missed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this tracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual evidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel online approach to learning the pose dynamics, which are independent of pose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation even in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Specifically, we derive this prediction of dynamics through a graph neural network (GNN) that explicitly accounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input the historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce the final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the estimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of the art on both human pose estimation and tracking tasks.","citations":0,"title":"Learning Dynamics via Graph Neural Networks for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking","twitter":null,"id":"b991751f-1851-5049-9266-c7e7c1402c72","s2id":"664ee0fb78e1a5ea53b3b7a23bd96db30772908d","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Yang_Learning_Dynamics_via_Graph_Neural_Networks_for_Human_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Yiding Yang","Zhou Ren","Haoxiang Li","Chunluan Zhou","Xinchao Wang","Gang Hua"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03772"}},{"node":{"abstract":"In this paper, we aim to synthesize cell microscopy images under different molecular interventions, motivated by practical applications to drug development.

The unbalanced reduction in the time spent per step limits the total search time reduction, and the inability to support non-differentiable search metrics limits the performance of discovered DNNs. In this paper, we present NetAdaptV2 with three innovations to better balance the time spent for each step while supporting non-differentiable search metrics. First, we propose channel-level bypass connections that merge network depth and layer width into a single search dimension to reduce the time for training and evaluating sampled DNNs. Second, ordered dropout is proposed to train multiple DNNs in a single forward-backward pass to decrease the time for training a super-network. Third, we propose the multi-layer coordinate descent optimizer that considers the interplay of multiple layers in each iteration of optimization to improve the performance of discovered DNNs while supporting non-differentiable search metrics. With these innovations, NetAdaptV2 reduces the total search time by up to 5.8x on ImageNet and 2.4x on NYU Depth V2, respectively, and discovers DNNs with better accuracy-latency/accuracy-MAC trade-offs than state-of-the-art NAS works.

In brief, for each sample from one view, our method aims to identify its within-category counterparts from other views, and thus the cross-view correspondence could be established. As the contrastive learning needs data pairs as input, we construct positive pairs using the known correspondences and negative pairs using random sampling. To alleviate or even eliminate the influence of the false negatives caused by random sampling, we propose a noise-robust contrastive loss that could adaptively prevent the false negatives from dominating the network optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first successful attempt of enabling contrastive learning robust to noisy labels. In fact, this work might remarkably enrich the learning paradigm with noisy labels. More specifically, the traditional noisy labels are defined as incorrect annotations for the supervised tasks such as classification. In contrast, this work proposes that the view correspondence might be false, which is remarkably different from the widely-accepted definition of noisy label.

Second, the decoder is overburdened during simultaneously reconstructing the content and structure of the image, resulting in vague performance. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we focus on the interpretable correction mechanism of the distortion rectification network and propose a feature-level correction scheme.

Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy to improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely locate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and the coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's transferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement module called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base trackers' box estimation quality.

It considers the natural hierarchies of data by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering, which can effectively excavate richer similarity information beyond binary in modeling.

To address this problem, we present Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization (CBN), in which examples from multiple recent iterations are jointly utilized to enhance estimation quality. A challenge of computing statistics over multiple iterations is that the network activations from different iterations are not comparable to each other due to changes in network weights. We thus compensate for the network weight changes via a proposed technique based on Taylor polynomials, so that the statistics can be accurately estimated and batch normalization can be effectively applied.

In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. On the nuScenes and Waymo datasets, CenterPoint surpasses prior methods by a large margin.

Although adding skipped connections, like Unet, alleviates the problem, but it often causes the failure on the view conformity. This paper proposes a new architecture by performing the source-to-target deformation in an iterative way. Instead of simply incorporating the features from multiple layers of the encoder, we design soft and hard deformation modules, which warp the encoder features to the target view at different resolutions, and give results to the decoder to complement the details. Particularly, the current warping flow is not only used to align the feature of the same resolution, but also as an approximation to coarsely deform the high resolution feature. Then the residual flow is estimated and applied in the high resolution, so that the deformation is built up in the coarse-to-fine fashion. To better constrain the model, we synthesize a rough target view image based on the intermediate flows and their warped features.

In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor decomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way. During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our proposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy. Notably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3X and 2.4X compression ratios, our models have 1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and ResNet-32, respectively.

Inspired by the principles of software metamorphic testing, we introduce MetaVQA, a model-agnostic framework for benchmarking perception capability of VQA models. Given an image i, MetaVQA is able to synthesize a low level perception question q. It then jointly transforms (i, q) to one or a set of sub-questions and sub-images. MetaVQA checks whether the answer to (i, q) satisfies metamorphic relationships (MRs), denoting perception consistency, with the composed answers of transformed questions and images. Violating MRs denotes a failure of answering perception questions. MetaVQA successfully detects over 4.9 million perception failures made by popular VQA models with metamorphic testing. The state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., the champion of VQA 2020 Challenge) suffer from perception consistency problems. In contrast, the Oscar VQA models, by using anchor points to align questions and images, show generally better consistency in perception tasks.

MI-AOD defines an instance uncertainty learning module, which leverages the discrepancy of two adversarial instance classifiers trained on the labeled set to predict instance uncertainty of the unlabeled set. MI-AOD treats unlabeled images as instance bags and feature anchors in images as instances, and estimates the image uncertainty by re-weighting instances in a multiple instance learning (MIL) fashion.

Existing approaches to image analysis mostly process objects independently and do not take into account the relative occlusion of nearby objects. In this paper, we propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box supervision only. Our work builds on Compositional Networks, which learn a generative model of neural feature activations to locate occluders and to classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend their generative model to include multiple objects and introduce a framework for efficient inference in challenging occlusion scenarios. In particular, we obtain feed-forward predictions of the object classes and their instance and occluder segmentations. We introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that locates erroneous segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to correct them. The improved segmentation masks are, in turn, integrated into the network in a top-down manner to improve the image classification. Our experiments on the KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model at multi-object instance segmentation under occlusion.

To demonstrate this, we present SimPoE, a Simulation-based approach for 3D human Pose Estimation, which integrates image-based kinematic inference and physics-based dynamics modeling. SimPoE learns a policy that takes as input the current-frame pose estimate and the next image frame to control a physically-simulated character to output the next-frame pose estimate. The policy contains a learnable kinematic pose refinement unit that uses 2D keypoints to iteratively refine its kinematic pose estimate of the next frame. Based on this refined kinematic pose, the policy learns to compute dynamics-based control (e.g., joint torques) of the character to advance the current-frame pose estimate to the pose estimate of the next frame. This design couples the kinematic pose refinement unit with the dynamics-based control generation unit, which are learned jointly with reinforcement learning to achieve accurate and physically-plausible pose estimation. Furthermore, we propose a meta-control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the character's dynamics parameters based on the character state to attain more accurate pose estimates. Experiments on large-scale motion datasets demonstrate that our approach establishes the new state of the art in pose accuracy while ensuring physical plausibility.","citations":1,"title":"SimPoE: Simulated Character Control for 3D Human Pose Estimation","twitter":{"likes":28,"replies":1,"retweets":2,"ids":["1377802301067436034","1378149482454515714"]},"id":"4a2fe4dd-a20f-5327-a1e8-56ef0bd1627d","s2id":"d9e8ac993cd75c1ab9364ba30a86444f2537a9c4","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Yuan_SimPoE_Simulated_Character_Control_for_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Ye Yuan","Shih-En Wei","Tomas Simon","Kris Kitani","Jason Saragih"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00683"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present STaR, a novel method that performs Self-supervised Tracking and Reconstruction of dynamic scenes with rigid motion from multi-view RGB videos without any manual annotation. Recent work has shown that neural networks are surprisingly effective at the task of compressing many views of a scene into a learned function which maps from a viewing ray to an observed radiance value via volume rendering. Unfortunately, these methods lose all their predictive power once any object in the scene has moved. In this work, we explicitly model rigid motion of objects in the context of neural representations of radiance fields. We show that without any additional human specified supervision, we can reconstruct a dynamic scene with a single rigid object in motion by simultaneously decomposing it into its two constituent parts and encoding each with its own neural representation. We achieve this by jointly optimizing the parameters of two neural radiance fields and a set of rigid poses which align the two fields at each frame. On both synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate that our method can render photorealistic novel views, where novelty is measured on both spatial and temporal axes. Our factored representation furthermore enables animation of unseen object motion.","citations":5,"title":"STaR: Self-Supervised Tracking and Reconstruction of Rigid Objects in Motion With Neural Rendering","twitter":{"likes":70,"replies":2,"retweets":16,"ids":["1346634293427236864"]},"id":"9648b00d-6c39-5ecd-b3ba-a530170379ee","s2id":"05f870bedcb2ac422be7ba3460229a6604420082","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Yuan_STaR_Self-Supervised_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_Rigid_Objects_in_Motion_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Wentao Yuan","Zhaoyang Lv","Tanner Schmidt","Steven Lovegrove"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01602"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) transfers predictive models from a fully-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.

Recent studies have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more, problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer, in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals. Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 accuracy of 78.9% on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to 80.2% with the CutMix regularization.

Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semisupervised video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics. Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model.

We show that the key reason is that the generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful one, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What would the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class, while keeping its sample attribute unchanged? Thanks to the faithfulness, we can apply the Consistency Rule to perform unseen/seen binary classification, by asking: Would its counterfactual still look like itself? If \"yes\", the sample is from a certain class, and \"no\" otherwise. Through extensive experiments on ZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the seen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance.

The existing approach for constructing neural radiance fields (NeRFs) involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, allowing it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks under category specific and category agnostic settings. We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes as well as real scenes from the DTU dataset.

A variety of discriminator loss functions have been developed to train GAN's discriminators and they all have a common structure: a sum of real and fake losses that only depends on the actual and generated data respectively. One challenge associated with an equally weighted sum of two losses is that the training may benefit one loss but harm the other, which we show causes instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new family of discriminator loss functions that adopts a weighted sum of real and fake parts, which we call adaptive weighted loss functions or aw-loss functions. Using the gradients of the real and fake parts of the loss, we can adaptively choose weights to train a discriminator in the direction that benefits the GAN's stability. Our method can be potentially applied to any discriminator model with a loss that is a sum of the real and fake parts.

However, this direct transfer practice may suffer from the discord between visual specificity and language fluency since they are often separately trained from large corpora of visual and text data with no common ground. In this work, we claim that a transitional adaptation task is required between pretraining and finetuning to harmonize the visual encoder and the language model for challenging downstream target tasks like visual storytelling. We propose a novel approach named Transitional Adaptation of Pretrained Model (TAPM) that adapts the multi-modal modules to each other with a simpler alignment task between visual inputs only with no need for text labels. Through extensive experiments, we show that the adaptation step significantly improves the performance of multiple language models for sequential video and image captioning tasks.

Our main proposal is a multi-stage architecture, that progressively learns restoration functions for the degraded inputs, thereby breaking down the overall recovery process into more manageable steps. Specifically, our model first learns the contextualized features using encoder-decoder architectures and later combines them with a high-resolution branch that retains local information. At each stage, we introduce a novel per-pixel adaptive design that leverages in-situ supervised attention to reweight the local features. A key ingredient in such a multi-stage architecture is the information exchange between different stages. To this end, we propose a two-faceted approach where the information is not only exchanged sequentially from early to late stages, but lateral connections between feature processing blocks also exist to avoid any loss of information. The resulting tightly interlinked multi-stage architecture, named as MPRNet, delivers strong performance gains on ten datasets across a range of tasks including image deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

Particularly, learning more object categories typically requires proportionally more bounding box annotations. Weakly supervised and zero-shot learning techniques have been explored to scale object detectors to more categories with less supervision, but they have not been as successful and widely adopted as supervised models. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects for which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a significantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches. Meanwhile, objects with bounding box annotation can be detected almost as accurately as supervised methods, which is significantly better than weakly supervised baselines. Accordingly, we establish a new state of the art for scalable object detection.","citations":1,"title":"Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Using Captions","twitter":{"likes":10,"replies":1,"retweets":1,"ids":["1331298952860233729","1331313543182839809","1331065102007754755","1332792186623189000","1331103513305202689"]},"id":"47dbcb9f-6f47-52d1-8b02-3883ccd87329","s2id":"497d765b1eccbc9e99a37592a1860744559695db","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zareian_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_Using_Captions_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Alireza Zareian","Kevin Dela Rosa","Derek Hao Hu","Shih-Fu Chang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10678"}},{"node":{"abstract":"We present deep neural network methodology to reconstruct the 3d pose and shape of people, including hand gestures and facial expression, given an input RGB image.

However, the task of cross-modal video moment retrieval is not yet thoroughly addressed as it needs to further identify the fine-grained differences of video moment candidates with high repeatability and similarity. Moveover, the relation among objects in both video and query sentence is intuitive and efficient for understanding semantics but is rarely considered.

Specifically, we first introduce a visual relational graph and a textual relational graph to form relation-aware representations via message propagation. Thereafter, a multi-task pre-training is designed to capture domain-specific knowledge about objects and relations, enhancing the structured visual representation after explicitly defined relation.

We show that such embedding of the in-distribution (ID) samples provides us with two main advantages. First, due to compact representation in the feature space, OOD samples are less likely to occupy the same region as the known classes. Second, the first singular vector of ID samples belonging to a 1-dimensional subspace can be used as their robust representative. Motivated by these observations, we train a deep neural network such that the ID samples are embedded onto a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. At the test time, employing sampling techniques used for approximate Bayesian inference in deep learning, input samples are detected as OOD if they occupy the region corresponding to the ID samples with probability 0. Spectral components of the ID samples are used as robust representative of this region.

Despite its importance, most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models perform primitive fusion strategies, such as concatenation, element-wise summation and weighted summation, to fuse features from different modalities. These strategies, unfortunately, overlook the modality differences due to different imaging mechanisms, so that they suffer from the reduced discriminability of the fused features. To address such an issue, we propose, for the first time, the strategy of bridging-then-fusing, where the innovation lies in a novel Adaptive-weighted Bi-directional Modality Difference Reduction Network (ABMDRNet). Concretely, a Modality Difference Reduction and Fusion (MDRF) subnetwork is designed, which first employs a bi-directional image-to-image translation based method to reduce the modality differences between RGB features and thermal features, and then adaptively selects those discriminative multi-modality features for RGB-T semantic segmentation in a channel-wise weighted fusion way. Furthermore, considering the importance of contextual information in semantic segmentation, a Multi-Scale Spatial Context (MSC) module and a Multi-Scale Channel Context (MCC) module are proposed to exploit the interactions among multi-scale contextual information of cross-modality features together with their long-range dependencies along spatial and channel dimensions, respectively.

Recent works have focused on an abstract reasoning task of this kind---Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Despite the encouraging progress on RPM that achieves human-level performance in terms of accuracy, modern approaches have neither a treatment of human-like reasoning on generalization, nor a potential to generate answers. To fill in this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic Probabilistic Abduction and Execution (PrAE) learner; central to the PrAE learner is the process of probabilistic abduction and execution on a probabilistic scene representation, akin to the mental manipulation of objects. Specifically, we disentangle perception and reasoning from a monolithic model. The neural visual perception frontend predicts objects' attributes, later aggregated by a scene inference engine to produce a probabilistic scene representation. In the symbolic logical reasoning backend, the PrAE learner uses the representation to abduce the hidden rules. An answer is predicted by executing the rules on the probabilistic representation. The entire system is trained end-to-end in an analysis-by-synthesis manner without any visual attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PrAE learner improves cross-configuration generalization and is capable of rendering an answer, in contrast to prior works that merely make a categorical choice from candidates.","citations":1,"title":"Abstract Spatial-Temporal Reasoning via Probabilistic Abduction and Execution","twitter":null,"id":"df4237b7-ebe4-5090-accf-daace11da4cd","s2id":"df74eb280e11b4774d80de073e3aeeb526b7cd15","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_Abstract_Spatial-Temporal_Reasoning_via_Probabilistic_Abduction_and_Execution_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Chi Zhang","Baoxiong Jia","Song-Chun Zhu","Yixin Zhu"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14230"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Most object detection methods require huge amounts of annotated data and can detect only the categories that appear in the training set.

Humans, even young toddlers, can induce causal relationships surprisingly well in various settings despite its notorious difficulty. However, in contrast to the commonplace trait of human cognition is the lack of a diagnostic benchmark to measure causal induction for modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the Abstract Causal REasoning (ACRE) dataset for systematic evaluation of current vision systems in causal induction. Motivated by the stream of research on causal discovery in Blicket experiments, we query a visual reasoning system with the following four types of questions in either an independent scenario or an interventional scenario: direct, indirect, screening-off, and backward-blocking, intentionally going beyond the simple strategy of inducing causal relationships by covariation. By analyzing visual reasoning architectures on this testbed, we notice that pure neural models tend towards an associative strategy under their chance-level performance, whereas neuro-symbolic combinations struggle in backward-blocking reasoning.

A major challenge is that the intrinsic similarities between such foreground objects and background surroundings make the features extracted by deep model indistinguishable. To overcome this challenge, an ideal model should be able to seek valuable, extra clues from the given scene and incorporate them into a joint learning framework for representation co-enhancement. With this inspiration, we design a novel Mutual Graph Learning (MGL) model, which generalizes the idea of conventional mutual learning from regular grids to the graph domain. Specifically, MGL decouples an image into two task-specific feature maps -- one for roughly locating the target and the other for accurately capturing its boundary details -- and fully exploits the mutual benefits by recurrently reasoning their high-order relations through graphs. Importantly, in contrast to most mutual learning approaches that use a shared function to model all between-task interactions, MGL is equipped with typed functions for handling different complementary relations to maximize information interactions.

In this work, we present a single stage model, Body Meshes as Points (BMP), to simplify the pipeline and lift both efficiency and performance. In particular, BMP adopts a new method that represents multiple person instances as points in the spatial-depth space where each point is associated with one body mesh. Hinging on such representations, BMP can directly predict body meshes for multiple persons in a single stage by concurrently localizing person instance points and estimating the corresponding body meshes. To better reason about depth ordering of all the persons within the same scene, BMP designs a simple yet effective inter-instance ordinal depth loss to obtain depth-coherent body mesh estimation. BMP also introduces a novel keypoint-aware augmentation to enhance model robustness to occluded person instances.

On the other hand, to cope with the redundancy, irrelevance, and noise contained in the Re-ID features caused by intra-class variations, we integrate 2O-IB into the network to compress and optimize the features, without increasing additional computation overhead during inference.

However, most state-of-the-art long-term trackers (e.g., Pseudo and re-detecting based ones) do not take all three key properties into account and therefore may either be time-consuming or drift to distractors. To address the issues, we propose a two-task tracking framework (named DMTrack), which utilizes two core components (i.e., one-shot detection and re-identification (re-id) association) to achieve distractor-aware fast tracking via Dynamic convolutions (d-convs) and Multiple object tracking (MOT) philosophy. To achieve precise and fast global detection, we construct a lightweight one-shot detector using a novel dynamic convolutions generation method, which provides a unified and more flexible way for fusing target information into the search field. To distinguish the target from distractors, we resort to the philosophy of MOT to reason distractors explicitly by maintaining all potential similarities' tracklets. Benefited from the strength of high recall detection and explicit object association, our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LaSOT, OxUvA, TLP, VOT2018LT and VOT2019LT benchmarks and runs in real-time (3x faster than comparisons).","citations":0,"title":"Distractor-Aware Fast Tracking via Dynamic Convolutions and MOT Philosophy","twitter":{"likes":1,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1387574383217020931"]},"id":"14e4dfaa-f097-5f7a-96d3-364aafd507d8","s2id":"16cf8225d1b86c54a18b917a9475bfbd68b46306","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_Distractor-Aware_Fast_Tracking_via_Dynamic_Convolutions_and_MOT_Philosophy_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Zikai Zhang","Bineng Zhong","Shengping Zhang","Zhenjun Tang","Xin Liu","Zhaoxiang Zhang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12041"}},{"node":{"abstract":"The objective of co-saliency detection is to segment the co-occurring salient objects in a group of images.

Recently, data-free quantization has been widely studied as a practical and promising solution. It synthesizes data for calibrating the quantized model according to the batch normalization (BN) statistics of FP32 ones and significantly relieves the heavy dependency on real training data in traditional quantization methods. Unfortunately, we find that in practice, the synthetic data identically constrained by BN statistics suffers serious homogenization at both distribution level and sample level and further causes a significant performance drop of the quantized model. We propose Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme to mitigate the adverse effects caused by homogenization. Specifically, we slack the alignment of feature statistics in the BN layer to relax the constraint at the distribution level and design a layerwise enhancement to reinforce specific layers for different data samples. Our DSG scheme is versatile and even able to be applied to the state-of-the-art post-training quantization method like AdaRound. We evaluate the DSG scheme on the large-scale image classification task and consistently obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and quantization methods, especially when quantized to lower bits (e.g., up to 22% improvement on W4A4).

To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream, transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts.

In this paper, we investigate volume preserving flows for lossless compression and show that a bijective mapping without error is possible. We propose Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) which is derived from the general volume preserving flows. By introducing novel computation algorithms on flow models, an exact bijective mapping is achieved without any numerical error. We also propose a lossless compression algorithm based on iVPF. Experiments on various datasets show that the algorithm based on iVPF achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio over lightweight compression algorithms.","citations":0,"title":"iVPF: Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow for Efficient Lossless Compression","twitter":null,"id":"1c9a1dd4-369b-5b8b-a0ac-f68e7918d166","s2id":"b7911e7a27103d04bf0232292cbdaf2bf1d1d4ca","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_iVPF_Numerical_Invertible_Volume_Preserving_Flow_for_Efficient_Lossless_Compression_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Shifeng Zhang","Chen Zhang","Ning Kang","Zhenguo Li"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16211"}},{"node":{"abstract":"One-shot talking face generation should synthesize high visual quality facial videos with reasonable animations of expression and head pose, and just utilize arbitrary driving audio and arbitrary single face image as the source. Current works fail to generate over 256 x 256 resolution realistic-looking videos due to the lack of an appropriate high-resolution audio-visual dataset, and the limitation of the sparse facial landmarks in providing poor expression details. To synthesize high-definition videos, we build a large in-the-wild high-resolution audio-visual dataset and propose a novel flow-guided talking face generation framework. The new dataset is collected from youtube and consists of about 16 hours 720P or 1080P videos. We leverage the facial 3D morphable model (3DMM) to split the framework into two cascaded modules instead of learning a direct mapping from audio to video. In the first module, we propose a novel animation generator to produce the movements of mouth, eyebrow and head pose simultaneously. In the second module, we transform animation into dense flow to provide more expression details and carefully design a novel flow-guided video generator to synthesize videos.

However, due to the domain shift of data distributions between real images and synthetic images, the network trained only on synthetic images fails to capture robust features in real images for 6D pose estimation. We propose to solve this problem by making the network insensitive to different domains, rather than taking the more difficult route of forcing synthetic images to be similar to real images. Inspired by domain adaption methods, a Domain Adaptive Keypoints Detection Network (DAKDN) including a domain adaption layer is used to minimize the discrepancy of deep features between synthetic and real images. A unique challenge here is the lack of ground truth labels (i.e., keypoints) for real images. Fortunately, the geometry relations between keypoints are invariant under real/synthetic domains. Hence, we propose to use the domain-invariant geometry structure among keypoints as a \"bridge\" constraint to optimize DAKDN for 6D pose estimation across domains. Specifically, DAKDN employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) block to learn the geometry structure from synthetic images and uses the GCN to guide the training for real images. The 6D poses of objects are calculated using Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm based on the predicted keypoints.

In contrast, existing techniques for learning to drive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an instrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver actions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where data is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely discard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained through indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key insight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables learning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state nor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and maneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given scene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of view, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust driving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick adaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives robustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing methods, achieving an average success rate of 92% on the original CARLA benchmark with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10 minutes.","citations":0,"title":"Learning by Watching","twitter":null,"id":"9d51e8ac-8489-5555-b867-32bedef58e34","s2id":"13853b7ef0bec694fa1a502b70aa0a7bfb18e9b7","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_Learning_by_Watching_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Jimuyang Zhang","Eshed Ohn-Bar"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"The facial expression analysis requires a compact and identity-ignored expression representation.

Most existing methods adopt a single image approach. Although their performance is satisfying on a static single image, we found, however, they suffer serious temporal instability when handling low light videos.

Unfortunately, training from real temporally consistent data is also problematic because it is impossible to collect pixel-wisely paired low and normal light videos under controlled environments in large scale and diversities with noise of identical statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enforce the temporal stability in low light video enhancement with only static images.

Unlike convolutions which are inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS, cannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in convolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed than GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of replacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS at the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to approximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this paper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all detectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS more precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy.

Pre-training based meta-learning methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during meta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative attribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to learn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype completion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.

However, due to the domain shift problem, applying the knowledge of an object detector learned from one specific domain to another one often suffers severe performance degradation. Most existing methods adopt feature alignment either on the backbone network or instance classifier to increase the transferability of object detector. Different from existing methods, we propose to perform feature alignment of foreground and background in the RPN stage such that the foreground and background RPN proposals in target domain can be effectively separated. Specifically, we first construct one set of learnable RPN prototypes, and then enforce the RPN features to align with the prototypes for both source and target domains. It essentially cooperates the learning of RPN prototypes and features to align the source and target RPN features. In this paradigm, the pseudo label of proposals in target domain need be first generated, and we propose a simple yet effective method suitable for RPN feature alignment,i.e., using the filtered detection results to guide the pseudo label generation of RPN proposals by IoU. Furthermore, we adopt Grad CAM to find the discriminative region within a proposal and use it to increase the discriminability of RPN features for alignment by spatially weighting. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain detection scenarios. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed method against previous state-of-the-art methods.","citations":null,"title":"RPN Prototype Alignment for Domain Adaptive Object Detector","twitter":null,"id":"6e41246e-2461-5b69-9656-e5383859ec64","s2id":"","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_RPN_Prototype_Alignment_for_Domain_Adaptive_Object_Detector_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Yixin Zhang","Zilei Wang","Yushi Mao"],"arXiv":null}},{"node":{"abstract":"Few-shot segmentation has been attracting a lot of attention due to its effectiveness to segment unseen object classes with a few annotated samples. Most existing approaches use masked Global Average Pooling (GAP) to encode an annotated support image to a feature vector to facilitate query image segmentation. However, this pipeline unavoidably loses some discriminative information due to the average operation. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective self-guided learning approach, where the lost critical information is mined. Specifically, through making an initial prediction for the annotated support image, the covered and uncovered foreground regions are encoded to the primary and auxiliary support vectors using masked GAP, respectively. By aggregating both the primary and auxiliary support vectors, better segmentation performance is obtained on query images. Enlightened by our self-guided module for 1-shot segmentation, we propose a cross-guided module for multiple shot segmentation, where the final mask is fused using predictions from multiple annotated samples with high-quality support vectors contributing more and vice versa. This module improves the final prediction in the inference stage without re-training. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets.

The undesirable phenomenon of multi-path occurs when a camera pixel simultaneously sees features from multiple projector coordinates. Bimodal multi-path is a particularly common situation found along step edges, where the camera pixel sees both a foreground and background surface. Generalized from bimodal multi-path, this paper looks at sparse or N modal multi-path as a more general case, where the camera pixel sees no less than two reflective surfaces, resulting in decoding errors. Using fringe projection profilometry, our proposed solution is to treat each camera pixel as an underdetermined linear system of equations and to find the sparsest (least number of paths) solution using an application-specific Bayesian learning approach.

These issues bring new challenges to 3D object detection, especially under the domain adaptation scenarios.

We take advantage of the geometric characteristics of 3D data (i.e., size and distance), and propose the scale-aware domain alignment and the range-aware domain alignment strategies to guide the distribution alignment between two domains. For scale-aware domain alignment, we design a 3D voxel-based feature pyramid network to extract multi-scale semantic voxel features, and align the features and instances with similar scales between two domains. For range-aware domain alignment, we introduce a range-guided domain alignment module to align the features of objects according to their distance to the capture device.

Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and graphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D joint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean formulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint rotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose, leaving degrees of freedom (like rotation about a limb) undefined. Note that 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as a problem of point cloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of locations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given such markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D body of the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information about human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the naturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO (More than Our JOints), which is a novel variational autoencoder with a latent DCT space that generates motions from latent frequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion, and sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency components into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods accumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from true human bodies. To address this, we fit the SMPL-X body model to the predictions at each time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies, before propagating the new markers in time. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach produces state-of-the-art results and realistic 3D body animations.

We exploit the feasibility to distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the nine other nonPDAC masses using multi-phase CT imaging. Both image appearance and the 3D organ-mass geometry relationship are critical. We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh-classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information, which is accomplished by combining the anatomical structure and the semantic detection-by-segmentation network. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask (i.e., mask-to-mesh). A new graph-based residual convolutional network (Graph-ResNet), whose nodes fuse the information of the mesh model and feature vectors extracted from the segmentation network, is developed to produce the patient-level differential classification results. Extensive experiments on 661 patients' CT scans (five phases per patient) show that SMCN can improve the mass segmentation and detection accuracy compared to the strong baseline method nnUNet (e.g., for nonPDAC, Dice: 0.611 vs. 0.478; detection rate: 89% vs. 70%), achieve similar sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PDAC and nonPDAC as expert radiologists (i.e., 94% and 90%), and obtain results comparable to a multimodality test [20] that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients.","citations":0,"title":"3D Graph Anatomy Geometry-Integrated Network for Pancreatic Mass Segmentation, Diagnosis, and Quantitative Patient Management","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1366459433967050756"]},"id":"17fb36fd-5e8a-5ee4-8cee-35423bcb6634","s2id":"f7acf9355deb04f63d51aa0905418ee2ab092d0f","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhao_3D_Graph_Anatomy_Geometry-Integrated_Network_for_Pancreatic_Mass_Segmentation_Diagnosis_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Thursday","authors":["Tianyi Zhao","Kai Cao","Jiawen Yao","Isabella Nogues","Le Lu","Lingyun Huang","Jing Xiao","Zhaozheng Yin","Ling Zhang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04701"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Estimating homography to align image pairs captured by different sensors or image pairs with large appearance changes is an important and general challenge for many computer vision applications.

The key contribution in our method is how we construct feature maps, named as deep Lucas-Kanade feature map (DLKFM). The learned DLKFM can spontaneously recognize invariant features under various appearance-changing conditions. It also has two nice properties for the Lucas-Kanade algorithm: (1) The template feature map keeps brightness consistency with the input feature map, thus the color difference is very small while they are well-aligned. (2) The Lucas-Kanade objective function built on DLKFM has a smooth landscape around ground truth homography parameters, so the iterative solution of the Lucas-Kanade can easily converge to the ground truth. With those properties, directly updating the Lucas-Kanade algorithm on our feature maps will precisely align image pairs with large appearance changes.

This motivates the adoption of the ensemble technique to learn a number of sub-embeddings using different and diverse subtasks. However, most subtasks impose weaker or contradictory constraints, which essentially sacrifices the discrimination ability of each sub-embedding to improve the generalization ability of their combination. To achieve a better generalization ability without compromising, we propose to separate the sub-embeddings from direct supervisions from the subtasks and apply the losses on different composites of the sub-embeddings. We employ a set of learnable compositors to combine the sub-embeddings and use a self-reinforced loss to train the compositors, which serve as relays to distribute the diverse training signals to avoid destroying the discrimination ability.

First, the unfolded architectures do not strictly follow the image representation model of DicL and lose the desired physical meaning. Second, handcrafted priors are still used in most unfolding methods without effectively utilizing the learning capability of DNNs. Third, a universal dictionary is learned to represent all images, reducing the model representation flexibility. We propose a novel framework of deep convolutional dictionary learning (DCDicL), which follows the representation model of DicL strictly, learns the priors for both representation coefficients and the dictionaries, and can adaptively adjust the dictionary for each input image based on its content. The effectiveness of our DCDicL method is validated on the image denoising problem. DCDicL demonstrates leading denoising performance in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and visual quality. In particular, it can reproduce the subtle image structures and textures, which are hard to recover by many existing denoising DNNs.

The scheme typically involves analyzing a \"smoothed\" classifier where one estimates the prediction corresponding to Gaussian samples in the neighborhood of each sample in the mini-batch, accomplished in practice by Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this sampling bottleneck can potentially be mitigated by identifying ways to directly propagate the covariance matrix of the smoothed distribution through the network. To this end, we find that other than certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also be accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the distributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network. We show how satisfying these criteria yields an algorithm for maximizing the certified radius on datasets including Cifar-10, ImageNet, and Places365 while offering runtime savings on networks with moderate depth, with a small compromise in overall accuracy. We describe the details of the key modifications that enable practical use.

One-stage models are more efficient due to their straightforward architectures, but the two-stage models are still advantageous in accuracy. Existing one-stage models usually begin by detecting predefined interaction areas or points, and then attend to these areas only for interaction prediction; therefore, they lack reasoning steps that dynamically search for discriminative cues. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage method, namely Glance and Gaze Network (GGNet), which adaptively models a set of action-aware points (ActPoints) via glance and gaze steps. The glance step quickly determines whether each pixel in the feature maps is an interaction point. The gaze step leverages feature maps produced by the glance step to adaptively infer ActPoints around each pixel in a progressive manner. Features of the refined ActPoints are aggregated for interaction prediction. Moreover, we design an action-aware approach that effectively matches each detected interaction with its associated human-object pair, along with a novel hard negative attentive loss to improve the optimization of GGNet. All the above operations are conducted simultaneously and efficiently for all pixels in the feature maps.

Existing methods typically first pre-train a model with labeled data, and then identify new classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled data that provide essential knowledge are often underexplored in the second step. The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difficult to build a learning relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with unlabeled examples. With the benefit of unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result, OpenMix helps preventing the model from overfitting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels. Second, the first way encourages the unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have considerable accuracy. We introduce these examples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with unlabeled samples. This enables us to generate more combinations in unlabeled examples and exploit finer object relations among the new classes.

In this work, we propose the Decoupled Dynamic Filter (DDF) that can simultaneously tackle both of these shortcomings. Inspired by recent advances in attention, DDF decouples a depth-wise dynamic filter into spatial and channel dynamic filters. This decomposition considerably reduces the number of parameters and limits computational costs to the same level as depth-wise convolution. Meanwhile, we observe a significant boost in performance when replacing standard convolution with DDF in classification networks. ResNet50 / 101 get improved by 1.9% and 1.3% on the top-1 accuracy, while their computational costs are reduced by nearly half.

This approach general leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we propose an effective network sparsification method called probabilistic masking (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under global sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global criterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature of ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned automatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning pruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method is highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the gap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to 10%.

This limits their applications in practical situations with multiple and incremental datasets where the mapping rules may change for different types of rain streaks. However, the catastrophic forgetting of traditional deep CNN model challenges the design of generalized framework for multiple and incremental datasets. A strategy of sharing the network structure but independently updating and storing the network parameters on each dataset has been developed as a potential solution. Nevertheless, this strategy is not applicable to compact systems as it dramatically increases the overall training time and parameter space. To alleviate such limitation, in this study, we propose a parameter importance guided weights modification approach, named PIGWM. Specifically, with new dataset (e.g. new rain dataset), the well-trained network weights are updated according to their importance evaluated on previous training dataset. With extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that a single network with a single parameter set of our proposed method can process multiple rain datasets almost without performance degradation. The proposed model is capable of achieving superior performance on both inhomogeneous and incremental datasets, and is promising for highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad regularities of the different types of rain streaks.

It can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods on open datasets neglect camera pose information, which inevitably results in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically, the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works independent of the extrinsic parameter variations, and produces accurate results in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing monocular detectors fail to handle.

Given object proposals from the instance discrimination network, three essential strategies are adopted to achieve accurate segmentation: 1) target-specific tracking using a memory-augmented appearance model; 2) target-agnostic verification to trace possible tracklets for the proposal; 3) adaptive memory updating using the verified segments.

Most existing technologies exploit patch similarities within the image, or leverage large-scale training data to fill the hole using learned semantic and texture information. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the inpainting task, such methods struggle to complete larger holes containing complicated scenes. In this paper, we propose TransFill, a multi-homography transformed fusion method to fill the hole by referring to another source image that shares scene contents with the target image. We first align the source image to the target image by estimating multiple homographies guided by different depth levels. We then learn to adjust the color and apply a pixel-level warping to each homography-warped source image to make it more consistent with the target. Finally, a pixel-level fusion module is learned to selectively merge the different proposals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on pairs of images across a variety of wide baselines and color differences, and generalizes to user-provided image pairs.","citations":0,"title":"TransFill: Reference-Guided Image Inpainting by Merging Multiple Color and Spatial Transformations","twitter":{"likes":18,"replies":0,"retweets":4,"ids":["1377083876607152129"]},"id":"1b5aef22-3235-5f01-9c49-be6a76fa746d","s2id":"9d0f18f1a92a1ec5fac9dd8d0089f621e7130981","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhou_TransFill_Reference-Guided_Image_Inpainting_by_Merging_Multiple_Color_and_Spatial_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Monday","authors":["Yuqian Zhou","Connelly Barnes","Eli Shechtman","Sohrab Amirghodsi"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15982"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Learning methods for relative camera pose estimation have been developed largely in isolation from classical geometric approaches. The question of how to integrate predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs) and solutions from geometric solvers, such as the 5-point algorithm, has as yet remained under-explored. In this paper, we present a novel framework that involves probabilistic fusion between the two families of predictions during network training, with a view to leveraging their complementary benefits in a learnable way. The fusion is achieved by learning the DNN uncertainty under explicit guidance by the geometric uncertainty, thereby learning to take into account the geometric solution in relation to the DNN prediction. Our network features a self-attention graph neural network, which drives the learning by enforcing strong interactions between different correspondences and potentially modeling complex relationships between points. We propose motion parmeterizations suitable for learning and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DeMoN and ScanNet datasets.

Departing from the recent literature which largely assumes the label noise rate is only determined by the true label class, the errors in human-annotated labels are more likely to be dependent on the difficulty levels of tasks, resulting in settings with instance-dependent label noise. We first provide evidences that the heterogeneous instance-dependent label noise is effectively down-weighting the examples with higher noise rates in a non-uniform way and thus causes imbalances, rendering the strategy of directly applying methods for class-dependent label noise questionable. Built on a recent work peer loss [24], we then propose and study the potentials of a second-order approach that leverages the estimation of several covariance terms defined between the instance-dependent noise rates and the Bayes optimal label. We show that this set of second-order statistics successfully captures the induced imbalances. We further proceed to show that with the help of the estimated second-order statistics, we identify a new loss function whose expected risk of a classifier under instance-dependent label noise is equivalent to a new problem with only class-dependent label noise. This fact allows us to apply existing solutions to handle this better-studied setting. We provide an efficient procedure to estimate these second-order statistics without accessing either ground truth labels or prior knowledge of the noise rates. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with synthetic instance-dependent label noise and Clothing1M with real-world human label noise verify our approach.

In this paper, we consider a face image as the production of the intervention of the underlying 3D geometry and the lighting environment, and decompose it in a computer graphics view. Specifically, by disentangling the face image into 3D shape, common texture, identity texture, ambient light, and direct light, we find the devil lies in the direct light and the identity texture. Based on this observation, we propose to utilize facial detail, which is the combination of direct light and identity texture, as the clue to detect the subtle forgery patterns. Besides, we highlight the manipulated region with a supervised attention mechanism and introduce a two-stream structure to exploit both face image and facial detail together as a multi-modality task.

Most of existing methods model text instances in image spatial domain via masks or contour point sequences in the Cartesian or the polar coordinate system. However, the mask representation might lead to expensive post-processing, while the point sequence one may have limited capability to model texts with highly-curved shapes. To tackle these problems, we model text instances in the Fourier domain and propose one novel Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method to represent arbitrary shaped text contours as compact signatures. We further construct FCENet with a backbone, feature pyramid networks (FPN) and a simple post-processing with the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Different from previous methods, FCENet first predicts compact Fourier signatures of text instances, and then reconstructs text contours via IFT and NMS during test. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FCE is accurate and robust to fit contours of scene texts even with highly-curved shapes, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of FCENet for arbitrary-shaped text detection. Furthermore, experimental results show that our FCENet is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CTW1500 and Total-Text, especially on challenging highly-curved text subset.","citations":1,"title":"Fourier Contour Embedding for Arbitrary-Shaped Text Detection","twitter":{"likes":0,"replies":0,"retweets":0,"ids":["1385527662798589954"]},"id":"defd250c-f9aa-5bf6-84e7-ec8a8ccc98ee","s2id":"08b6f8cdaaa3d090f0ffab2c41fc1261a24d7b76","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhu_Fourier_Contour_Embedding_for_Arbitrary-Shaped_Text_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Tuesday","authors":["Yiqin Zhu","Jianyong Chen","Lingyu Liang","Zhanghui Kuang","Lianwen Jin","Wayne Zhang"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10442"}},{"node":{"abstract":"Knowledge distillation aims to transfer representation ability from a teacher model to a student model.

In this work, we propose an approach to learn neural representations of camera poses and 3D scenes, coupled with neural representations of local camera movements. Specifically, the camera pose and 3D scene are represented as vectors and the local camera movement is represented as a matrix operating on the vector of the camera pose.

The vector representations are then concatenated and generate the posed 2D image through a decoder network. The model is learned from only posed 2D images and corresponding camera poses, without access to depth or shape. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Finally, the swapped faces can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately so the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel face swapping.

In this paper, we propose a simple non-exemplar based method named PASS, to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in incremental learning.

However, standard 3D sensors fail to capture depth of transparent objects due to refraction and absorption of light. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for depth completion of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image. Key to our approach is a local implicit neural representation built on ray-voxel pairs that allows our method to generalize to unseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation, we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-D input. We further improve the depth estimation iteratively using a self-correcting refinement model. To train the whole pipeline, we build a large scale synthetic dataset with transparent objects.

Its performance is largely affected by the data scarcity of novel classes. But the semantic relation between the novel classes and the base classes is constant regardless of the data availability. In this work, we investigate utilizing this semantic relation together with the visual information and introduce explicit relation reasoning into the learning of novel object detection. Specifically, we represent each class concept by a semantic embedding learned from a large corpus of text. The detector is trained to project the image representations of objects into this embedding space. We also identify the problems of trivially using the raw embeddings with a heuristic knowledge graph and propose to augment the embeddings with a dynamic relation graph. As a result, our few-shot detector, termed SRR-FSD, is robust and stable to the variation of shots of novel objects. Experiments show that SRR-FSD can achieve competitive results at higher shots, and more importantly, a significantly better performance given both lower explicit and implicit shots. The benchmark protocol with implicit shots removed from the pretrained classification dataset can serve as a more realistic setting for future research.","citations":3,"title":"Semantic Relation Reasoning for Shot-Stable Few-Shot Object Detection","twitter":{"likes":8,"replies":0,"retweets":2,"ids":["1366947776035254275"]},"id":"111a3a11-75ee-5817-9f4f-7de79067c0d3","s2id":"62dfb5fabe1e1d2d31e8a7e8e89c87072969b793","pdf":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhu_Semantic_Relation_Reasoning_for_Shot-Stable_Few-Shot_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","posterSession":"Wednesday","authors":["Chenchen Zhu","Fangyi Chen","Uzair Ahmed","Zhiqiang Shen","Marios Savvides"],"arXiv":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01903"}},{"node":{"abstract":"The ability to navigate like a human towards a language-guided target from anywhere in a 3D embodied environment is one of the 'holy grail' goals of intelligent robots. Most visual navigation benchmarks, however, focus on navigating toward a target from a fixed starting point, guided by an elaborate set of instructions that depicts step-by-step. This approach deviates from real-world problems in which human-only describes what the object and its surrounding look like and asks the robot to start navigation from anywhere. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a Scenario Oriented Object Navigation (SOON) task. In this task, an agent is required to navigate from an arbitrary position in a 3D embodied environment to localize a target following a scene description. To give a promising direction to solve this task, we propose a novel graph-based exploration (GBE) method, which models the navigation state as a graph and introduces a novel graph-based exploration approach to learn knowledge from the graph and stabilize training by learning sub-optimal trajectories. We also propose a new large-scale benchmark named From Anywhere to Object (FAO) dataset. To avoid target ambiguity, the descriptions in FAO provide rich semantic scene information includes: object attribute, object relationship, region description, and nearby region description. Our experiments reveal that the proposed GBE outperforms various state-of-the-arts on both FAO and R2R datasets.

Recent works have achieved surprisingly high retrieval accuracy on city-scale datasets. However, these results rely on the assumption that there exists a reference image exactly centered at the location of any query image, which is not applicable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we redefine this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be arbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of existing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location. To bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we propose a new large-scale benchmark --VIGOR-- for cross-View Image Geo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval. We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods and propose a novel end-to-end framework to localize the query in a coarse-to-fine manner. Apart from the image-level retrieval accuracy, we also evaluate the localization accuracy in terms of the actual distance (meters) using the raw GPS data. Extensive experiments are conducted under different application scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that cross-view geo-localization in this realistic setting is still challenging, fostering new research in this direction.

However, unlike the independence assumption, interpretability has rarely been exploited to encourage disentanglement in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we examine the interpretability of disentangled representations by investigating two questions: where to be interpreted and what to be interpreted? A latent code is easily to be interpreted if it would consistently impact a certain subarea of the resulting generated image. We thus propose to learn a spatial mask to localize the effect of each individual latent dimension. On the other hand, interpretability usually comes from latent dimensions that capture simple and basic variations in data. We thus impose a perturbation on a certain dimension of the latent code, and expect to identify the perturbation along this dimension from the generated images so that the encoding of simple variations can be enforced. Additionally, we develop an unsupervised model selection method, which accumulates perceptual distance scores along axes in the latent space. On various datasets, our models can learn high-quality disentangled representations without supervision, showing the proposed modeling of interpretability is an effective proxy for achieving unsupervised disentanglement.","citations":1,"title":"Where and What?
