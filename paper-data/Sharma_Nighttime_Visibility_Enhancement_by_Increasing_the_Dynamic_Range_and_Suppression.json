  "abstract": "Most existing nighttime visibility enhancement methods focus on low light. Night images, however, do not only suffer from low light, but also from man-made light effects such as glow, glare, floodlight, etc. Hence, when the existing nighttime visibility enhancement methods are applied to these images, they intensify the effects, degrading the visibility even further. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging methods can address the low light and over-exposed regions, however they cannot remove the light effects, and thus cannot enhance the visibility in the affected regions. In this paper, given a single nighttime image as input, our goal is to enhance its visibility by increasing the dynamic range of the intensity, and thus can boost the intensity of the low light regions, and at the same time, suppress the light effects (glow, glare) simultaneously. First, we use a network to estimate the camera response function (CRF) from the input image to linearise the image. Second, we decompose the linearised image into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) feature maps that are processed separately through two networks for light effects suppression and noise removal respectively. Third, we use a network to increase the dynamic range of the processed LF feature maps, which are then combined with the processed HF feature maps to generate the final output that has increased dynamic range and suppressed light effects. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art nighttime visibility enhancement methods.",
