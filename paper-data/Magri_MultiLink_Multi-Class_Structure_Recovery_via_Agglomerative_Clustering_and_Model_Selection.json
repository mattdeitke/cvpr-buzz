  "abstract": "We address the problem of recovering multiple structures of different classes in a dataset contaminated by noise and outliers. In particular, we consider geometric structures defined by a mixture of underlying parametric models (e.g. planes and cylinders, homographies and fundamental matrices), and we tackle the robust fitting problem by preference analysis and clustering. We present a new algorithm, termed MultiLink, that simultaneously deals with multiple classes of models. MultiLink wisely combines on-the-fly model fitting and model selection in a novel linkage scheme that determines whether two clusters are to be merged. The resulting method features many practical advantages with respect to methods based on preference analysis, being faster, less sensitive to the inlier threshold, and able to compensate limitations deriving from hypotheses sampling. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that MultiLink favorably compares with state of the art alternatives, both in multi-class and single-class problems. Code is publicly made available for download.",
