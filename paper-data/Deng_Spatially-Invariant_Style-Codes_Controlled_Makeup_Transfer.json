  "abstract": "Transferring makeup from the misaligned reference image is challenging. Previous methods overcome this barrier by computing pixel-wise correspondences between two images, which is inaccurate and computational-expensive. In this paper, we take a different perspective to break down the makeup transfer problem into a two-step extraction-assignment process. To this end, we propose a Style-based Controllable GAN model that consists of three components, each of which corresponds to target style-code encoding, face identity features extraction, and makeup fusion, respectively. In particular, a Part-specific Style Encoder encodes the component-wise makeup style of the reference image into a style-code in an intermediate latent space W. The style-code discards spatial information and therefore is invariant to spatial misalignment. On the other hand, the style-code embeds component-wise information, enabling flexible partial makeup editing from multiple references. This style-code, together with source identity features, are integrated to a Makeup Fusion Decoder equipped with multiple AdaIN layers to generate the final result. Our proposed method demonstrates great flexibility on makeup transfer by supporting makeup removal, shade-controllable makeup transfer, and part-specific makeup transfer, even with large spatial misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/makeuptransfer/SCGAN.",
