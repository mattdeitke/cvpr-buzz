  "abstract": "Semi-supervised generative learning (SSGL) makes use of unlabeled data to achieve a trade-off between the data collection/annotation effort and generation performance, when adequate labeled data are not available. Learning precise class semantics is crucial for class-conditional image synthesis with limited supervision. Toward this end, we propose a semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network with a Mask-Embedded Discriminator, which is referred to as MED-GAN. By incorporating a mask embedding module, the discriminator features are associated with spatial information, such that the focus of the discriminator can be limited in the specified regions when distinguishing between real and synthesized images. A generator is enforced to synthesize the instances holding more precise class semantics in order to deceive the enhanced discriminator. Also benefiting from mask embedding, region-based semantic regularization is imposed on the discriminator feature space, and the degree of separation between real and fake classes and among object categories can thus be increased. This eventually improves class-conditional distribution matching between real and synthesized data. In the experiments, the superior performance of MED-GAN demonstrates the effectiveness of mask embedding and associated regularizers in facilitating SSGL.",
