  "abstract": "Extracting detailed 3D information of objects from video data is an important goal for holistic scene understanding. While recent methods have shown impressive results when reconstructing meshes of objects from a single image, results often remain ambiguous as part of the object is unobserved. Moreover, existing image-based datasets for mesh reconstruction don't permit to study models which integrate temporal information. To alleviate both concerns we present SAIL-VOS 3D: a synthetic video dataset with frame-by-frame mesh annotations which extends SAIL-VOS. We also develop first baselines for reconstruction of 3D meshes from video data via temporal models. We demonstrate efficacy of the proposed baseline on SAIL-VOS 3D and Pix3D, showing that temporal information improves reconstruction quality.
