  "abstract": "Driven by the success of deep learning, the last decade has seen rapid advances in person re-identification (re-ID). Nonetheless, most of approaches assume that the input is given with the fulfillment of expectations, while imperfect input remains rarely explored to date, which is a non-trivial problem since directly apply existing methods without adjustment can cause significant performance degradation. In this paper, we focus on recognizing partial (flawed) input with the assistance of proposed Part-Part Correspondence Learning (PPCL), a self-supervised learning framework that learns correspondence between image patches without any additional part-level supervision. Accordingly, we propose Part-Part Cycle (PP-Cycle) constraint and Part-Part Triplet (PP-Triplet) constraint that exploit the duality and uniqueness between corresponding image patches respectively. We verify our proposed PPCL on several partial person re-ID benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can surpass previous methods in terms of the standard evaluation metric.",
