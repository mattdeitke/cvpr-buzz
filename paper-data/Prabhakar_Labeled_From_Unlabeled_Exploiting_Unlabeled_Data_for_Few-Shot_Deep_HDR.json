  "abstract": "High Dynamic Range (HDR) deghosting is an indispensable tool in capturing wide dynamic range scenes without ghosting artifacts. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown tremendous success in HDR deghosting. However, CNN-based HDR deghosting methods require collecting large datasets with ground truth, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. This paper proposes a pioneering work by introducing zero and few-shot learning strategies for data-efficient HDR deghosting. Our approach consists of two stages of training. In stage one, we train the model with few labeled (5 or less) dynamic samples and a pool of unlabeled samples with a self-supervised loss. We use the trained model to predict HDRs for the unlabeled samples. To derive data for the next stage of training, we propose a novel method for generating corresponding dynamic inputs from the predicted HDRs of unlabeled data. The generated artificial dynamic inputs and predicted HDRs are used as paired labeled data. In stage two, we finetune the model with the original few labeled data and artificially generated labeled data. Our few-shot approach outperforms many fully-supervised methods in two publicly available datasets, using as little as five labeled dynamic samples.",
