  "abstract": "Monocular 3D prediction is one of the fundamental problems in 3D vision. Recent deep learning-based approaches have brought us exciting progress on this problem. However, existing approaches have predominantly focused on end-to-end depth and normal predictions, which do not fully utilize the underlying 3D environment's geometric structures. This paper introduces StruMonoNet, which detects and enforces a planar structure to enhance pixel-wise predictions. StruMonoNet innovates in leveraging a hybrid representation that combines visual feature and a surfel representation for plane prediction. This formulation allows us to combine the power of visual feature learning and the flexibility of geometric representations in incorporating geometric relations. As a result, StruMonoNet can detect relations between planes such as adjacent planes, perpendicular planes, and parallel planes, all of which are beneficial for dense 3D prediction. Experimental results show that StruMonoNet considerably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on NYUv2 and ScanNet.",
