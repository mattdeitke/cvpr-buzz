  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new dataset with the target of advancing the scene parsing task from images to videos. Our dataset aims to perform Video Scene Parsing in the Wild (VSPW), which covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories. To be specific, our VSPW is featured from the following aspects: 1) Well-trimmed long-temporal clips. Each video contains a complete shot, lasting around 5 seconds on average. 2) Dense annotation. The pixel-level annotations are provided at a high frame rate of 15 f/s. 3) High resolution. Over 96% of the captured videos are with high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4K. We totally annotate 3,337 videos, including 239,934 frames from 124 categories. To the best of our knowledge, our VSPW is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VSPW, we design a generic Temporal Context Blending (TCB) network, which can effectively harness long-range contextual information from the past frames to help segment the current one. Extensive experiments show that our TCB network improves both the segmentation performance and temporal stability comparing with image-/video-based state-of-the-art methods. We hope that the scale, diversity, long-temporal, and high frame rate of our VSPW can significantly advance the research of video scene parsing and beyond.",
