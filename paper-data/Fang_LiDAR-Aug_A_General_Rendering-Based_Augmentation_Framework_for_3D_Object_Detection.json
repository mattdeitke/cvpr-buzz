  "abstract": "Annotating the LiDAR point cloud is crucial for deep learning-based 3D object detection tasks. Due to expensive labeling costs, data augmentation has been taken as a necessary module and plays an important role in training the neural network. \"Copy\" and \"paste\" (i.e., GT-Aug) is the most commonly used data augmentation strategy, however, the occlusion between objects has not been taken into consideration. To handle the above limitation, we propose a rendering-based LiDAR augmentation framework (i.e., LiDAR-Aug) to enrich the training data and boost the performance of LiDAR-based 3D object detectors. The proposed LiDAR-Aug is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into different types of 3D object detection frameworks. Compared to the traditional object augmentation methods, LiDAR-Aug is more realistic and effective. Finally, we verify the proposed framework on the public KITTI dataset with different 3D object detectors. The experimental results show the superiority of our method compared to other data augmentation strategies. We plan to make our data and code public to help other researchers reproduce our results.",
