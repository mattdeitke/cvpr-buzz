  "abstract": "Temporal video grounding aims to localize the target segment which is semantically aligned with the given sentence in an untrimmed video. Existing methods can be divided into two main categories, including proposal-based approaches and proposal-free approaches. However, the former ones suffer from the extra cost of generating proposals and inflexibility in determining fine-grained boundaries, and the latter ones usually attempt to decide the start and end timestamps directly, which brings about much difficulty and inaccuracy. In this paper, we convert this task into a multi-step decision problem and propose a novel Cascaded Prediction Network (CPN) to generate the grounding result in a coarse-to-fine manner. Concretely, we first encode video and query into the same latent space and fuse them into integrated representations. Afterwards, we construct a segment-tree-based structure and make predictions via decision navigation and signal decomposition in a cascaded way. We evaluate our proposed method on three large-scale publicly available benchmarks, namely ActivityNet Caption, Charades-STA and TACoS, where our CPN surpasses the performance of the state-of-the-art methods.",
