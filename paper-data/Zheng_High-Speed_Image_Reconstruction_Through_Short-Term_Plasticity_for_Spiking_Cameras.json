  "abstract": "Fovea, located in the centre of the retina, is specialized for high-acuity vision. Mimicking the sampling mechanism of the fovea, a retina-inspired camera, named spiking camera, is developed to record the external information with a sampling rate of 40,000 Hz, and outputs asynchronous binary spike streams. Although the temporal resolution of visual information is improved, how to reconstruct the scenes is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel high-speed image reconstruction model through the short-term plasticity (STP) mechanism of the brain. We derive the relationship between postsynaptic potential regulated by STP and the firing frequency of each pixel. By setting up the STP model at each pixel of the spiking camera, we can infer the scene radiance with the temporal regularity of the spike stream. Moreover, we show that STP can be used to distinguish the static and motion areas and further enhance the reconstruction results. The experimental results show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and computing time.",
