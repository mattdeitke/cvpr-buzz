  "abstract": "We address the problem of unsupervised localization of key-steps and feature learning in instructional videos using both visual and language instructions. Our key observation is that the sequences of visual and linguistic key-steps are weakly aligned: there is an ordered one-to-one correspondence between most visual and language key-steps, while some key-steps in one modality are absent in the other. To recover the two sequences, we develop an ordered prototype learning module, which extracts visual and linguistic prototypes representing key-steps. On the other hand, to find weak alignment and perform feature learning, we develop a differentiable weak sequence alignment (DWSA) method that finds ordered one-to-one matching between sequences while allowing some items in a sequence to stay unmatched. We develop an efficient forward and backward algorithm for computing the alignment and the loss derivative with respect to parameters of visual and language feature learning modules. By experiments on two instructional video datasets, we show that our method significantly improves the state of the art.",
