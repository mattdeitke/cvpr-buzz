  "abstract": "The goal is to use Wasserstein metric to provide pseudo labels for the unlabeled images to train a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) manner for the classification task. The basic premise in our method is that the discrepancy between two discrete empirical measures (e.g., clusters) which come from the same or similar distribution is expected to be less than the case where these measures come from completely two different distributions. In our proposed method, we first pre-train our CNN using a self-supervised learning method to make a cluster assumption on the unlabeled images. Next, inspired by the Wasserstein metric which considers the geometry of the metric space to provide a natural notion of similarity between discrete empirical measures, we leverage it to cluster the unlabeled images and then match the clusters to their similar class of labeled images to provide a pseudo label for the data within each cluster. We have evaluated and compared our method with state-of-the-art SSL methods on the standard datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
