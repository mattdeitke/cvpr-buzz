  "abstract": "Under-display camera (UDC) technology is essential for full-screen display in smartphones and is achieved by removing the concept of drilling holes on display. However, this causes inevitable image degradation in the form of spatially variant blur and noise because of the opaque display in front of the camera. To address spatially variant blur and noise in UDC images, we propose a novel controllable image restoration algorithm utilizing pixel-wise UDC-specific kernel representation and a noise estimator. The kernel representation is derived from an elaborate optical model that reflects the effect of both normal and oblique light incidence. Also, noise-adaptive learning is introduced to control noise levels, which can be utilized to provide optimal results depending on the user preferences. The experiments showed that the proposed method achieved superior quantitative performance as well as higher perceptual quality on both a real-world dataset and a monitor-based aligned dataset compared to conventional image restoration algorithms.",
