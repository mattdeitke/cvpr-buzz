  "abstract": "Multi-source domain adaptation is a key technique that allows a model to be trained on data coming from various probability distribution. To overcome the challenges posed by this learning scenario, we propose a method for constructing an intermediate domain between sources and target domain, the Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT). This method relies on the barycenter on Wasserstein spaces for aggregating the source probability distributions. Once the sources have been aggregated, they are transported to the target domain using standard Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation framework. Additionally, we revisit previous single-source domain adaptation tasks in the context of multi-source scenario. In particular, we apply our algorithm to object and face recognition datasets. Moreover, to diversify the range of applications, we also examine the tasks of music genre recognition and music-speech discrimination. The experiments show that our method has similar performance with the existing state-of-the-art.",
