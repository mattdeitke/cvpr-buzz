  "abstract": "Deep learning based methods have shown dramatic improvements in image rain removal by using large-scale paired data of synthetic datasets. However, due to the various appearances of real rain streaks that may be different from those in the synthetic training data, it is challenging to directly extend existing methods to the real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose a memory-oriented semi-supervised (MOSS) method which enables the network to explore and exploit the properties of rain streaks from both synthetic and real data. The key aspect of our method is designing an encoder-decoder neural network that is augmented with a self-supervised memory module, where items in the memory record the prototypical patterns of rain degradations and are updated in a self-supervised way. Consequently, the rainy styles can be comprehensively derived from synthetic or real-world degraded images without the need for clean labels. Furthermore, we present a self-training mechanism that attempts to transfer deraining knowledge from supervised rain removal to unsupervised cases. An additional target network, which is updated with an exponential moving average of the online deraining network, is utilized to produce pseudo-labels for unlabeled rainy images. Meanwhile, the deraining network is optimized with supervised objectives on both synthetic paired data and pseudo-paired noisy data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves more appealing results not only on limited labeled data but also on unlabeled real-world images than recent state-of-the-art methods.",
