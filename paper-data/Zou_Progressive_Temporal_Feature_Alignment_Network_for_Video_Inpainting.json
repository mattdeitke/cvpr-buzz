  "abstract": "Video inpainting aims to fill spatio-temporal \"corrupted\" regions with plausible content. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to find correspondences from neighbouring frames to faithfully hallucinate the unknown content. Current methods achieve this goal through attention, flow-based warping, or 3D temporal convolution. However, flow-based warping can create artifacts when optical flow is not accurate, while temporal convolution may suffer from spatial misalignment. We propose `Progressive Temporal Feature Alignment Network', which progressively enriches features extracted from the current frame with the feature warped from neighbouring frames using optical flow. Our approach corrects the spatial misalignment in the temporal feature propagation stage, greatly improving visual quality and temporal consistency of the inpainted videos. Using the proposed architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and FVI datasets compared to existing deep learning approaches.
