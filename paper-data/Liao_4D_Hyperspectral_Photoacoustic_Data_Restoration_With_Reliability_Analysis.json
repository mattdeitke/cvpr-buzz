  "abstract": "Hyperspectral photoacoustic (HSPA) spectroscopy is an emerging bi-modal imaging technology that is able to show the wavelength-dependent absorption distribution of the interior of a 3D volume. However, HSPA devices have to scan an object exhaustively in the spatial and spectral domains; and the acquired data tend to suffer from complex noise. This time-consuming scanning process and noise severely affects the usability of HSPA. It is therefore critical to examine the feasibility of 4D HSPA data restoration from an incomplete and noisy observation. In this work, we present a data reliability analysis for the depth and spectral domain. On the basis of this analysis, we explore the inherent data correlations and develop a restoration algorithm to recover 4D HSPA cubes. Experiments on real data verify that the proposed method achieves satisfactory restoration results.",
