  "abstract": "Sufficient real information in generator is a critical point for the generation ability of GAN. However, GAN and its variants suffer from lack of this point, resulting in brittle training processes. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of GAN, Posterior Promoted GAN (P2GAN), which promotes generator with the real information in the posterior distribution produced by discriminator. In our framework, different from other variants of GAN, the discriminator maps images to a multivariate Gaussian distribution and extracts real information. The generator employs the real information by AdaIN and a latent code regularizer. Besides, reparameterization trick and pretraining is applied to guarantee a stable training process in practice. The convergence of P2GAN is theoretically proved. Experimental results on typical high-dimensional multi-modal datasets demonstrate that P2GAN has achieved comparable results with the state-of-the-art variants of GAN on unsupervised image synthesis.",
