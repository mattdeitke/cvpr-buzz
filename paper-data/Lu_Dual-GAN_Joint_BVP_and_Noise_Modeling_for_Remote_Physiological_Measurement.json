  "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based physiological measurement has great application values in health monitoring, emotion analysis, etc. Existing methods mainly focus on how to enhance or extract the very weak blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from face videos, but seldom explicitly model the noises that dominate face video content. Thus, they may suffer from poor generalization ability in unseen scenarios. This paper proposes a novel adversarial learning approach for rPPG based physiological measurement by using Dual Generative Adversarial Networks (Dual-GAN) to model the BVP estimation and noise distribution jointly. The BVP-GAN aims to learn a noise-resistant mapping from input to ground-truth BVP, and the Noise-GAN aims to learn the noise distribution. The dual GANs can promote each other's capability, leading to improved feature disentanglement between BVP and noises. Besides, a plug-and-play block named ROI alignment and fusion (ROI-AF) block is proposed to alleviate the inconsistencies between different ROIs and exploit informative features from a wider receptive field in terms of ROIs. In comparison to state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration frequency estimation from face videos.",
