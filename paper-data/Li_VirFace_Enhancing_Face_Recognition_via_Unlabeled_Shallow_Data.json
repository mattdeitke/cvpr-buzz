  "abstract": "Recently, exploiting the effect of the unlabeled data for face recognition attracts increasing attention. However, there are still few works considering the situation that the unlabeled data is shallow which widely exists in real-world scenarios. The existing semi-supervised face recognition methods which focus on generating pseudo labels or minimizing softmax classification probabilities of the unlabeled data don't work very well on the unlabeled shallow data. Thus, it is still a challenge on how to effectively utilize the unlabeled shallow face data for improving the performance of face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition method, named VirFace, to effectively apply the unlabeled shallow data for face recognition. VirFace consists of VirClass and VirInstance. Specifically, VirClass enlarges the inter-class distance by injecting the unlabeled data as new identities. Furthermore, VirInstance produces virtual instances sampled from the learned distribution of each identity to further enlarge the inter-class distance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first working on tackling the unlabeled shallow face data. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both the small- and large-scale datasets, e.g. LFW and IJB-C, etc, showing the superiority of the proposed method.",
