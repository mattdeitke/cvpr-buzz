  "abstract": "Despite considerable similarities between multiple object tracking (MOT) and single object tracking (SOT) tasks, modern MOT methods have not benefited from the development of SOT ones to achieve satisfactory performance. The major reason for this situation is that it is inappropriate and inefficient to apply multiple SOT models directly to the MOT task, although advanced SOT methods are of the strong discriminative power and can run at fast speeds. In this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end trainable MOT architecture that extends CenterNet by adding an SOT branch for tracking objects in parallel with the existing branch for object detection, allowing the MOT task to benefit from the strong discriminative power of SOT methods in an effective and efficient way. Unlike most existing SOT methods which learn to distinguish the target object from its local backgrounds, the added SOT branch trains a separate SOT model per target online to distinguish the target from its surrounding targets, assigning SOT models the novel discrimination. Moreover, similar to the detection branch, the SOT branch treats objects as points, making its online learning efficient even if multiple targets are processed simultaneously. Without tricks, the proposed tracker achieves MOTAs of 0.710 and 0.686, IDF1s of 0.719 and 0.714, on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, respectively, while running at 16 FPS on MOT17.",
