  "abstract": "Capturing challenging human motions is critical for numerous applications, but it suffers from complex motion patterns and severe self-occlusion under the monocular setting. In this paper, we propose ChallenCap --- a template-based approach to capture challenging 3D human motions using a single RGB camera in a novel learning-and-optimization framework, with the aid of multi-modal references. We propose a hybrid motion inference stage with a generation network, which utilizes a temporal encoder-decoder to extract the motion details from the pair-wise sparse-view reference, as well as a motion discriminator to utilize the unpaired marker-based references to extract specific challenging motion characteristics in a data-driven manner. We further adopt a robust motion optimization stage to increase the tracking accuracy, by jointly utilizing the learned motion details from the supervised multi-modal references as well as the reliable motion hints from the input image reference. Extensive experiments on our new challenging motion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach to capture challenging human motions.",
