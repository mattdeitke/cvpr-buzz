  "abstract": "Snapshot hyperspectral imaging has been developed to capture the spectral information of dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network by learning the tensor low-rank prior of hyperspectral images (HSI) in the feature domain to promote the reconstruction quality. Our method is inspired by the canonical-polyadic (CP) decomposition theory, where a low-rank tensor can be expressed as a weight summation of several rank-1 component tensors. Specifically, we first learn the tensor low-rank prior of the image features with two steps: (a) we generate rank-1 tensors with discriminative components to collect the contextual information from both spatial and channel dimensions of the image features; (b) we aggregate those rank-1 tensors into a low-rank tensor as a 3D attention map to exploit the global correlation and refine the image features. Then, we integrate the learned tensor low-rank prior into an iterative optimization algorithm to obtain an end-to-end HSI reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method.",
