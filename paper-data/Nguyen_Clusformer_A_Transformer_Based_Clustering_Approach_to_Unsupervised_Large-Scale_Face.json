  "abstract": "The research in automatic unsupervised visual clustering has received considerable attention over the last couple years. It aims at explaining distributions of unlabeled visual images by clustering them via a parameterized model of appearance. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) have recently been one of the most popular clustering methods. However, it has reached some limitations. Firstly, it is quite sensitive to hard or noisy samples. Secondly, it is hard to investigate with various deep network models due to its computational training time. Finally, it is hard to design an end-to-end training model between the deep feature extraction and GCN clustering modeling. This work therefore presents the Clusformer, a simple but new perspective of Transformer based approach, to automatic visual clustering via its unsupervised attention mechanism. The proposed method is able to robustly deal with noisy or hard samples. It is also flexible and effective to collaborate with different deep network models with various model sizes in an end-to-end framework. The proposed method is evaluated on two popular large-scale visual databases, i.e. Google Landmark and MS-Celeb-1M face database, and outperforms prior unsupervised clustering methods.
