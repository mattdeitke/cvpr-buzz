  "abstract": "Image-text matching is an important multi-modal task with massive applications. It tries to match the image and the text with similar semantic information. Existing approaches do not explicitly transform the different modalities into a common space. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism which is widely used in image-text matching models does not have supervision. We propose a novel attention scheme which projects the image and text embedding into a common space and optimises the attention weights directly towards the evaluation metrics. The proposed attention scheme can be considered as a kind of supervised attention and requiring no additional annotations. It is trained via a novel Discrete-continuous action space policy gradient algorithm, which is more effective in modelling complex action space than previous continuous action space policy gradient. We evaluate the proposed methods on two widely-used benchmark datasets: Flickr30k and MS-COCO, outperforming the previous approaches by a large margin.",
