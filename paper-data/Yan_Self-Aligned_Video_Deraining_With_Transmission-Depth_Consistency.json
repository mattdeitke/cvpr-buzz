  "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problems of rain streaks and rain accumulation removal in video, by developing a self-aligned network with transmission-depth consistency. Existing video based deraining method focus only on rain streak removal, and commonly use optical flow to align the rain video frames. However, besides rain streaks, rain accummulation can considerably degrade visibility; and, optical flow estimation in a rain video is still erroneous, making the deraining performance tend to be inaccurate. Our method employs deformable convolution layers in our encoder to achieve feature-level frame alignment, and hence avoids using optical flow. For rain streaks, our method predicts the current frame from its adjacent frames, such that rain streaks that appear randomly in the temporal domain can be removed. For rain accumulation, our method employs transmission-depth consistency to resolve the ambiguity between the depth and water-droplet density. Our network estimates the depth from consecutive rain-accumulation-removal outputs, and we calculate the transmission map using a commonly used physics model. To ensure photometric-temporal and depth-temporal consistencies, our network also estimate the camera poses, so that we can warp one frame to its adjacent frames. Experimental results show that our method is effective in removing both rain streaks and rain accumulation. Our results outperform those of state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.",
