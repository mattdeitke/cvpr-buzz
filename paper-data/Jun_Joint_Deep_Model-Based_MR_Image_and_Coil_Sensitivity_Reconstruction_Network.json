  "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide diagnostic information with high-resolution and high-contrast images. However, MRI requires a relatively long scan time compared to other medical imaging techniques, where long scan time might occur patient's discomfort and limit the increase in resolution of magnetic resonance (MR) image. In this study, we propose a Joint Deep Model-based MR Image and Coil Sensitivity Reconstruction Network, called Joint-ICNet, which jointly reconstructs an MR image and coil sensitivity maps from undersampled multi-coil k-space data using deep learning networks combined with MR physical models. Joint-ICNet has two main blocks, where one is an MR image reconstruction block that reconstructs an MR image from undersampled multi-coil k-space data and the other is a coil sensitivity maps reconstruction block that estimates coil sensitivity maps from undersampled multi-coil k-space data. The desired MR image and coil sensitivity maps can be obtained by sequentially estimating them with two blocks based on the unrolled network architecture. To demonstrate the performance of Joint-ICNet, we performed experiments with a fastMRI brain dataset for two reduction factors (R = 4 and 8). With qualitative and quantitative results, we demonstrate that our proposed Joint-ICNet outperforms conventional parallel imaging and deep-learning-based methods in reconstructing MR images from undersampled multi-coil k-space data.",
