  "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation(VOS). Multiple works have shown that memory-based approaches can be effective for video object segmentation. They are mostly based on pixel-level matching, both spatially and temporally. The main shortcoming of memory-based approaches is that they do not take into account the sequential order among frames and do not exploit object-level knowledge from the target. To address this limitation, we propose to learn position and target consistency framework for memory-based video object segmentation, termed as LCM. It applies the memory mechanism to retrieve pixels globally, and meanwhile learns position consistency for more reliable segmentation. The learned location response promotes a better discrimination between target and distractors. Besides, LCM introduces an object-level relationship from the target to maintain target consistency, making LCM more robust to error drifting. Experiments show that our LCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and Youtube-VOS benchmark. And we rank the 1st in the DAVIS 2020 challenge semi-supervised VOS task.",
