  "abstract": "Although existing fully-supervised defocus blur detection (DBD) models significantly improve performance, training such deep models requires abundant pixel-level manual annotation, which is highly time-consuming and error-prone. Addressing this issue, this paper makes an effort to train a deep DBD model without using any pixel-level annotation. The core insight is that a defocus blur region/focused clear area can be arbitrarily pasted to a given realistic full blurred image/full clear image without affecting the judgment of the full blurred image/full clear image. Specifically, we train a generator G in an adversarial manner against dual discriminators Dc and Db. G learns to produce a DBD mask that generates a composite clear image and a composite blurred image through copying the focused area and unfocused region from corresponding source image to another full clear image and full blurred image. Then, Dc and Db can not distinguish them from realistic full clear image and full blurred image simultaneously, achieving a self-generated DBD by an implicit manner to define what a defocus blur area is. Besides, we propose a bilateral triplet-excavating constraint to avoid the degenerate problem caused by the case one discriminator defeats the other one. Comprehensive experiments on two widely-used DBD datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Source codes are available at: https://github.com/shangcai1/SG.",
