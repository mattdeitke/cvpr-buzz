  "abstract": "Generating high-quality stitched images with natural structures is a challenging task in computer vision. In this paper, we succeed in preserving both local and global geometric structures for wide parallax images, while reducing artifacts and distortions. A projective invariant, Characteristic Number, is used to match co-planar local sub-regions for input images. The homography between these well-matched sub-regions produces consistent line and point pairs, suppressing artifacts in overlapping areas. We explore and introduce global collinear structures into an objective function to specify and balance the desired characters for image warping, which can preserve both local and global structures while alleviating distortions. We also develop comprehensive measures for stitching quality to quantify the collinearity of points and the discrepancy of matched line pairs by considering the sensitivity to linear structures for human vision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art by presenting sharp textures and preserving prominent natural structures in stitched images. Especially, our method not only exhibits lower errors but also the least divergence across all test images. Code is available at https://github.com/dut-media-lab/Image-Stitching",
