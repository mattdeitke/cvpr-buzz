  "abstract": "Recently, person re-identification (Re-ID) has achieved great progress. However, current methods largely depend on color appearance, which is not reliable when a person changes the clothes. Cloth-changing Re-ID is challenging since pedestrian images with clothes change exhibit large intra-class variation and small inter-class variation. Some significant features for identification are embedded in unobvious body shape differences across pedestrians. To explore such body shape cues for cloth-changing Re-ID, we propose a Fine-grained Shape-Appearance Mutual learning framework (FSAM), a two-stream framework that learns fine-grained discriminative body shape knowledge in a shape stream and transfers it to an appearance stream to complement the cloth-unrelated knowledge in the appearance features. Specifically, in the shape stream, FSAM learns fine-grained discriminative mask with the guidance of identities and extracts fine-grained body shape features by a pose-specific multi-branch network. To complement cloth-unrelated shape knowledge in the appearance stream, dense interactive mutual learning is performed across low-level and high-level features to transfer knowledge from shape stream to appearance stream, which enables the appearance stream to be deployed independently without extra computation for mask estimation. We evaluated our method on benchmark cloth-changing Re-ID datasets and achieved the start-of-the-art performance.",
