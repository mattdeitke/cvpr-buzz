  "abstract": "This paper presents a view-guided solution for the task of point cloud completion. Unlike most existing methods directly inferring the missing points using shape priors, we address this task by introducing ViPC (view-guided point cloud completion) that takes the missing crucial global structure information from an extra single-view image. By leveraging a framework which sequentially performs effective cross-modality and cross-level fusions, our method achieves significantly superior results over typical existing solutions on a new large-scale dataset we collect for the view-guided point cloud completion task.",
