  "abstract": "We present Meta Pseudo Labels, a semi-supervised learning method that achieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 90.2% on ImageNet, which is 1.6% better than the existing state-of-the-art. Like Pseudo Labels, Meta Pseudo Labels has a teacher network to generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data to teach a student network. However, unlike Pseudo Labels where the teacher is kept fixed, in Meta Pseudo Labels, the teacher is constantly adapted by the feedback of how well the student performs on the labeled dataset. As a result, the teacher generates better pseudo labels to teach the student.",
