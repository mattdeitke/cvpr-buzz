  "abstract": "The task of point cloud completion aims to predict the missing part for an incomplete 3D shape. A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover. It moves move each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore, PMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the constraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a strict and unique correspondence on point-level, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which demonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.
