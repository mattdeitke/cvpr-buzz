  "abstract": "Weakly supervised temporal action detection aims to localize temporal boundaries of actions and identify their categories simultaneously with only video-level category labels during training. Among existing methods, attention-based methods have achieved superior performance by separating action and non-action segments. However, without the segment-level ground-truth supervision, the quality of the attention weight hinders the performance of these methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Uncertainty Guided Collaborative Training (UGCT) strategy, which mainly includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an online pseudo label generation module, in which the RGB and FLOW streams work collaboratively to learn from each other. (2) The second design is an uncertainty aware learning module, which can mitigate the noise in the generated pseudo labels. These two designs work together to promote the model performance effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art attentionbased methods demonstrate that the proposed training strategy can significantly improve the performance of these methods, e.g., more than 4% for all three methods in terms of mAP@IoU=0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset.",
