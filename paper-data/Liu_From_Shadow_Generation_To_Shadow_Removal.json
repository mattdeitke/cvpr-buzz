  "abstract": "Shadow removal is a computer-vision task that aims to restore the image content in shadow regions. While almost all recent shadow-removal methods require shadow-free images for training, in ECCV 2020 Le and Samaras introduces an innovative approach without this requirement by cropping patches with and without shadows from shadow images as training samples. However, it is still laborious and time-consuming to construct a large amount of such unpaired patches. In this paper, we propose a new G2R-ShadowNet which leverages shadow generation for weakly-supervised shadow removal by only using a set of shadow images and their corresponding shadow masks for training. The proposed G2R-ShadowNet consists of three sub-networks for shadow generation, shadow removal and refinement, respectively and they are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the shadow generation sub-net stylises non-shadow regions to be shadow ones, leading to paired data for training the shadow-removal sub-net. Extensive experiments on the ISTD dataset and the Video Shadow Removal dataset show that the proposed G2R-ShadowNet achieves competitive performances against the current state of the arts and outperforms Le and Samaras' patch-based shadow-removal method.",
