  "abstract": "Dense Event Captioning (DEC) aims to jointly localize and describe multiple events of interest in untrimmed videos, which is an advancement of the conventional video captioning task (generating a single sentence description for a trimmed video). Weakly Supervised Dense Event Captioning (WS-DEC) goes one step further by not relying on human-annotated temporal event boundaries. However, there are few methods trying to tackle this task, and how to connect localization and description remains an open problem. In this paper, we demonstrate that under weak supervision, the event captioning module and localization module should be more closely bridged in order to improve description performance. Different from previous approaches, in our method, the event captioner generates a sentence from a video segment and feeds it to the sentence localizer to reconstruct the segment, and the localizer produces word importance weights as a guidance for the captioner to improve event description. To further bridge the sentence localizer and event captioner, a concept learner is adopted as the basis of the sentence localizer, which can be utilized to construct an induced set of concept features to enhance video features and improve the event captioner. Finally, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art WS-DEC methods on the ActivityNet Captions dataset.",
