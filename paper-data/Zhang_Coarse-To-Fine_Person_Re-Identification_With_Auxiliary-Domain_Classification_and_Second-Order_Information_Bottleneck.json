  "abstract": "Person re-identification (Re-ID) is to retrieve a particular person captured by different cameras, which is of great significance for security surveillance and pedestrian behavior analysis. However, due to the large intra-class variation of a person across cameras, e.g., occlusions, illuminations, viewpoints, and poses, Re-ID is still a challenging task in the field of computer vision. In this paper, to attack the issues concerning with intra-class variation, we propose a coarse-to-fine Re-ID framework with the incorporation of auxiliary-domain classification (ADC) and second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB). In particular, as an auxiliary task, ADC is introduced to extract the coarse-grained essential features to distinguish a person from miscellaneous backgrounds, which leads to the effective coarse- and fine-grained feature representations for Re-ID. On the other hand, to cope with the redundancy, irrelevance, and noise contained in the Re-ID features caused by intra-class variations, we integrate 2O-IB into the network to compress and optimize the features, without increasing additional computation overhead during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the neural network output variance of intra-class person images and achieves the superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.",
