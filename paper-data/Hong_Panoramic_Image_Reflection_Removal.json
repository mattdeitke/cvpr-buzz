  "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of panoramic image reflection removal, aiming at reliving the content ambiguity between reflection and transmission scenes. Although a partial view of the reflection scene is included in the panoramic image, it cannot be utilized directly due to its misalignment with the reflection-contaminated image. We propose a two-step approach to solve this problem, by first accomplishing geometric and photometric alignment for the reflection scene via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and then restoring the transmission scene via a recovery network. The proposed method is trained with a synthetic dataset and verified quantitatively with a real panoramic image dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the significant performance advantage over single image-based reflection removal methods and generalization capacity to limited-FoV scenarios captured by conventional camera or mobile phone users.",
