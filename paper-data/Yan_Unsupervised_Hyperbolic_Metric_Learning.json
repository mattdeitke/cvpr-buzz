  "abstract": "Learning feature embedding directly from images without any human supervision is a very challenging and essential task in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Following the paradigm in supervised manner, most existing unsupervised metric learning approaches mainly focus on binary similarity in Euclidean space. However, these methods cannot achieve promising performance in many practical applications, where the manual information is lacking and data exhibits non-Euclidean latent anatomy. To address this limitation, we propose an Unsupervised Hyperbolic Metric Learning method with Hierarchical Similarity. It considers the natural hierarchies of data by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering, which can effectively excavate richer similarity information beyond binary in modeling. More importantly, we design a new loss function to capture the hierarchical similarity among samples to enhance the stability of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with current unsupervised deep metric learning approaches.",
