  "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to learn detectors that can be generalized to novel classes with only a few instances. Unlike previous attempts that exploit meta-learning techniques to facilitate FSOD, this work tackles the problem from the perspective of sample expansion. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Transformation Invariant Principle (TIP) that can be flexibly applied to various meta-learning models for boosting the detection performance on novel class objects. Specifically, by introducing consistency regularization on predictions from various transformed images, we augment vanilla FSOD models with the generalization ability to objects perturbed by various transformation, such as occlusion and noise. Importantly, our approach can extend supervised FSOD models to naturally cope with unlabeled data, thus addressing a more practical and challenging semi-supervised FSOD problem. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIP under both of the two FSOD settings.",
