  "abstract": "Event cameras are novel sensors that capture the dynamics of a scene asynchronously. Such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency than images captured by conventional cameras, and are also highly sensitive to intensity change, which is brought by the triggering mechanism of events. On the basis of these two features, previous works attempt to reconstruct high speed and high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events. However, these works either suffer from unrealistic artifacts, or cannot provide sufficiently high frame rate. In this paper, we present a convolutional recurrent neural network which takes a sequence of neighboring events to reconstruct high speed HDR videos, and temporal consistency is well considered to facilitate the training process. In addition, we setup a prototype optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high speed HDR videos and event streams, which will be made publicly accessible for future researches in this field. Experimental results on both simulated and real scenes verify that our method can generate high speed HDR videos with high quality, and outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.",
