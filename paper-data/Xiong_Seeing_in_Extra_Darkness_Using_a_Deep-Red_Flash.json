  "abstract": "We propose a new flash technique for low-light imaging, using deep-red light as an illuminating source. Our main observation is that in a dim environment, the human eye mainly uses rods for the perception of light, which are not sensitive to wavelengths longer than 620nm, yet the camera sensor still has a spectral response. We propose a novel modulation strategy when training a modern CNN model for guided image filtering, fusing a noisy RGB frame and a flash frame. This fusion network is further extended for video reconstruction. We have built a prototype with minor hardware adjustments and tested the new flash technique on a variety of static and dynamic scenes. The experimental results demonstrate that our method produces compelling reconstructions, even in extra dim conditions.",
