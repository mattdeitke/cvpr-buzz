  "abstract": "What scene elements, if any, are indispensable for recognizing a scene? We strive to answer this question through the lens of an end-to-end learning scheme. Our goal is to identify a collection of such pivotal elements, which we term as Scene Essence, to be those that would alter scene recognition if taken out from the scene. To this end, we devise a novel approach that learns to partition the scene objects into two groups, essential ones and minor ones, under the supervision that if only the essential ones are kept while the minor ones are erased in the input image, a scene recognizer would preserve its original prediction. Specifically, we introduce a learnable graph neural network (GNN) for labelling scene objects, based on which the minor ones are wiped off by an off-the-shelf image inpainter. The features of the inpainted image derived in this way, together with those learned from the GNN with the minor-object nodes pruned, are expected to fool the scene discriminator. Both subjective and objective evaluations on Places365, SUN397, and MIT67 datasets demonstrate that, the learned Scene Essence yields a visually plausible image that convincingly retains the original scene category.",
