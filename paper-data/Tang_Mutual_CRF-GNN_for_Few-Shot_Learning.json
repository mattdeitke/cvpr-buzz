  "abstract": "Graph-neural-networks (GNN) is a rising trend for few-shot learning. A critical component in GNN is the affinity. Typically, affinity in GNN is mainly computed in the feature space, e.g., pairwise features, and does not take fully advantage of semantic labels associated to these features. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual CRF-GNN (MCGN). In this MCGN, the labels and features of support data are used by the CRF for inferring GNN affinities in a principled and probabilistic way. Specifically, we construct a Conditional Random Field (CRF) conditioned on labels and features of support data to infer a affinity in the label space. Such affinity is fed to the GNN as the node-wise affinity. GNN and CRF mutually contributes to each other in MCGN. For GNN, CRF provides valuable affinity information. For CRF, GNN provides better features for inferring affinity. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts on datasets miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and CIFAR-FS on both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings.",
