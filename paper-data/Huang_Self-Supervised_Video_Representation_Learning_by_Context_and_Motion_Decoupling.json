  "abstract": "A key challenge in self-supervised video representation learning is how to effectively capture motion information besides context bias. While most existing works implicitly achieve this with video-specific pretext tasks (e.g., predicting clip orders, time arrows, and paces), we develop a method that explicitly decouples motion supervision from context bias through a carefully designed pretext task. Specifically, we take the key frames and motion vectors in compressed videos (e.g., in H.264 format) as the supervision sources for context and motion, respectively, which can be efficiently extracted at over 500 fps on CPU. Then we design two pretext tasks that are jointly optimized: a context matching task where a pairwise contrastive loss is cast between video clip and key frame features; and a motion prediction task where clip features, passed through an encoder-decoder network, are used to estimate motion features in a near future. These two tasks use a shared video backbone and separate MLP heads. Experiments show that our approach improves the quality of the learned video representation over previous works, where we obtain absolute gains of 16.0% and 11.1% in video retrieval recall on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. Moreover, we find the motion prediction to be a strong regularization for video networks, where using it as an auxiliary task improves the accuracy of action recognition with a margin of 7.4%   13.8%.",
