  "abstract": "To address the problem of long-tail distribution for the large vocabulary object detection task, existing methods usually divide the whole categories into several groups and treat each group with different strategies. These methods bring the following two problems. One is the training inconsistency between adjacent categories of similar sizes, and the other is that the learned model is lack of discrimination for tail categories which are semantically similar to some of the head categories. In this paper, we devise a novel Adaptive Class Suppression Loss (ACSL) to effectively tackle the above problems and improve the detection performance of tail categories. Specifically, we introduce a statistic-free perspective to analyze the long-tail distribution, breaking the limitation of manual grouping. According to this perspective, our ACSL adjusts the suppression gradients for each sample of each class adaptively, ensuring the training consistency and boosting the discrimination for rare categories. Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets LVIS and Open Images show that the our ACSL achieves 5.18% and 5.2% improvements with ResNet50-FPN, and sets a new state of the art.
