  "abstract": "Image denoising, demosaicing and super-resolution are key problems of image restoration well studied in the recent decades. Often, in practice, one has to solve these problems simultaneously. A problem of finding a joint solution of the multiple image restoration tasks just begun to attract an increased attention of researchers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution for the joint demosaicing, denoising and super-resolution based on a specially designed deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We systematically study different methods to solve this problem and compared them with the proposed method. Extensive experiments carried out on large image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we have applied various loss functions in the proposed scheme and demonstrate that by using the mean absolute error as a loss function, we can obtain superior results in comparison to other cases.",
