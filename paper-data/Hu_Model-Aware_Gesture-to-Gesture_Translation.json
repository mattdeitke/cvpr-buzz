  "abstract": "Hand gesture-to-gesture translation is a significant and interesting problem, which serves as a key role in many applications, such as sign language production. This task involves fine-grained structure understanding of the mapping between the source and target gestures. Current works follow a data-driven paradigm based on sparse 2D joint representation. However, given the insufficient representation capability of 2D joints, this paradigm easily leads to blurry generation results with incorrect structure. In this paper, we propose a novel model-aware gesture-to-gesture translation framework, which introduces hand prior with hand meshes as the intermediate representation. To take full advantage of the structured hand model, we first build a dense topology map aligning the image plane with the encoded embedding of the visible hand mesh. Then, a transformation flow is calculated based on the correspondence of the source and target topology map. During the generation stage, we inject the topology information into generation streams by modulating the activations in a spatially-adaptive manner. Further, we incorporate the source local characteristic to enhance the translated gesture image according to the transformation flow. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",
