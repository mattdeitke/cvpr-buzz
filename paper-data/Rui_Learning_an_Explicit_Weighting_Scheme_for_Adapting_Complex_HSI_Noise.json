  "abstract": "A general approach for handling hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising issue is to impose weights on different HSI pixels to suppress negative influence brought by noisy elements. Such weighting scheme, however, largely depends on the prior understanding or subjective distribution assumption on HSI noises, making them easily biased to complicated real noises, and hardly generalizable to diverse practical scenarios. Against this issue, this paper proposes a new scheme aiming to capture general weighting principle in a data-driven manner. Specifically, such weighting principle is delivered by an explicit function, called hyperweight-net (HWnet), mapping from an input noisy image to its properly imposed weights. A Bayesian framework, as well as a variational inference algorithm, for inferring HWnet parameters is elaborately designed, expecting to extract the latent weighting rule for general diverse and complicated noisy HSIs. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the learned HWnet can be not only finely generalized to different noise types from those used in training, but also effectively transferred to other weighted models for the issue. Besides, as a sounder guidance, HWnet can help to more faithfully and robustly achieve deep hyperspectral prior(DHP). Specially, the extracted weights by HWnet are verified to be able to effectively capture complex noise knowledge underlying input HSI, revealing its working insight in experiments.",
