  "abstract": "Recent single-view 3D reconstruction methods reconstruct object's shape and texture from a single image with only 2D image-level annotation. However, without explicit 3D attribute-level supervision, it is still difficult to achieve satisfying reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Mesh Reconstruction (SMR) approach to enhance 3D mesh attribute learning process. Our approach is motivated by observations that (1) 3D attributes from interpolation and prediction should be consistent, and (2) feature representation of landmarks from all images should be consistent. By only requiring silhouette mask annotation, our SMR can be trained in an end-to-end manner and generalizes to reconstruct natural objects of birds, cows, motorbikes, etc. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves both 2D supervised and unsupervised 3D mesh reconstruction on multiple datasets. We also show that our model can be adapted to other image synthesis tasks, e.g., novel view generation, shape transfer, and texture transfer, with promising results.
